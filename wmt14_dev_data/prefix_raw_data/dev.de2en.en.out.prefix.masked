while deputies and human rights activists argue about the purpose of the law on mandatory language testing <mask>
every year , 13 million migrant workers come to <mask>

a new law came into effect on <mask>
for the moment , this law <mask>
but with time - as promised by the federal migration service - <mask>
in addition to language , russian history and basics of the legal system <mask>
language knowledge will have to be confirmed both to receive and to <mask>

seven testing points will be operating under the auspices of the pushkin institute of russian language , peoples &apos; friendship university of russia , moscow state university ( <mask>
migrants can take the tests in all cities ; more than <mask>
the initiative to introduce the testing was supported by <mask>
but human rights activists , asked the question repeatedly <mask>
what will <mask>
first of all , according <mask>
many speak about protection of the rights of work migrants , explains the <mask>
rights protection should begin before <mask>
only the system of organized selection will enable <mask>
migrants without profession , <mask>
if a migrant does not understand the language , says sebelev with certainty , he is doomed to come across unconscientious people , who , pretending to help , will force upon him a &quot; ticket &quot; to terrible , cramped barracks where many others like him <mask>
we receive many complaints <mask>
&quot; they are promised one thing at home , but when they arrive , <mask>
not be angry <mask>
nonetheless , many citizens of central asian countries , who plan to go to work in russia , admit that not only their understanding of the language of the country where they are going is not good , but they <mask>
naturally , this is not so much their fault , but due to poverty : very few <mask>
their families don &apos;t even have food to feed their children , not to mention <mask>
after <mask>
it is hard , if language knowledge is <mask>
&quot; <mask>
but human rights activists note one important point <mask>
testing will be conducted <mask>
if they have no status , there will be no testing , nor any official work <mask>
in the meantime , most of the migrant workers continue <mask>

many of <mask>
the reason lies in bureaucratic hurdles and the <mask>

on the first day of the law &apos;s entry into <mask>
a few forged certificates about passing language tests have been seized by federal migration <mask>

it is two and a half times more than the process of official testing , <mask>

the idea was supported by the head of the duma committee on safety and anti ##at##-##at## corruption , irina yarovaya , who promised that the amendments to the law on weapons will be brought to the state duma in the near <mask>

among modern technology fans a popular topic is augmented reality , lately seen primarily through the prism of special <mask>

- in general , the current generation is what we can base ourselves on in working <mask>
of course , it would be good to have eight mega pixels <mask>
it &apos;s not just the mega pixels , though , but the quality <mask>
from the latter point of view , all current technologies are not good enough for us - this adds work to <mask>
so it &apos;s important to remember about the resolution on the x , y , but also the z <mask>

human movements are relatively dynamic , and the current 30 k / <mask>

nku head : svarc system audit <mask>
the czech republic has sound control bodies and a good standard of legislation when it comes <mask>
this was said by miloslav kala , vice ##at##-##at## president <mask>
&quot; the law will never <mask>
similar conclusions are also reached by the joint audit from the <mask>
as an example of improper practice , they cite petr necas &apos;s approach to <mask>
the prime minister recently claimed that the ods <mask>
&quot; the law must be set out one way or the other and if it prohibits something , then even the government &apos;s head cannot prevent the work of its department , which is duty ##at##-##at## bound to <mask>
at the audit committee &apos;s session in the house of deputies , you spoke about a joint project between the czech republic and germany , within which legislation relating to public <mask>
what exactly was <mask>
this is about parallel auditing , which we began around <mask>
simply put , this is about how european legislation governs the handling of public contracts , followed by individual <mask>
we brought all this together , and although the audit is not yet complete , some very interesting differences have become apparent - in general terms , our <mask>
this confirms that creating more and more concise rules is <mask>
what does this project actually help you with , and what do you <mask>
this kind of joint audit could contribute to curtailing these efforts to specify our <mask>
economy means acquiring the required thing at a reasonable ( which does not always mean the lowest ) price , so <mask>
however , just because we have reduced the order limits , <mask>
the system might become overloaded with the amount of <mask>
these are domestic problems about the practical implementation of <mask>
how does the audit system work in <mask>
is there an office like the nku , <mask>
as far as the office is concerned , the bundesrechnungshof functions like our nku , and it is organised like ours , it also has a committee although it is appointed slightly differently <mask>
powers are also similar to a degree , though <mask>
the brh can only audit federal money , known to us as <mask>
public funds , which , for us , are administered by regional and municipal authorities , are <mask>
when it comes to their legislation , is it more straightforward <mask>
overall , i would not like to make a comparison without any specific <mask>
is this because , perhaps <mask>
that is certainly not <mask>
it should be said that even in a country we perceive as <mask>
if that were not the case , they would gain nothing from working with <mask>
coming back to domestic legislation , what did the amendment to <mask>
the period since the amendment came into force has been quite short , so it has not manifested itself in our <mask>
since we carry out our audits <mask>
as yet , we have only observed it within the process of preparing future audits - we have launched our new &quot; fiscal failure <mask>
so do you see the adoption of this legislation as a benefit , or rather as another burden on the <mask>
i believe this legislation is <mask>
a problem , which may arise here , is that the <mask>
under the previous rules , parties being audited were already bound by their audit provider ( for example , in the case of regional operational programmes , the regional office ) to the fact that every <mask>
is it worth constraining the law in this way <mask>
i do not think <mask>
the system should prevent those who want to attack and abuse it , but not penalise those , who make a mistake on <mask>
this kind of system will only increase pressure on <mask>
so how <mask>
let &apos;s see <mask>
the prime minister recently said the ods will not be burdening businessmen with audits of <mask>
is the svarc system <mask>
the law must be set out one way or the other , and if it prohibits something , then even the government &apos;s head cannot prevent the <mask>
he may say : &quot; let us change this law and relax it , &quot; <mask>

on this basis , it should be understood that when a supplier tries to compete in a commercial tender by importing cheap goods , &quot; the rug is pulled &quot; from under the competition &apos;s prices to capture a greater market share and , in this way , <mask>
on a wider scale , this means most businesses must move production abroad , import cheaply from abroad , or close <mask>

just such a scandal was revealed in the case of <mask>
the austerity measures for all the southern eu states will undoubtedly lead to the same situation , where people are pressured by a catastrophic drop in living standards to emigrate <mask>
at this <mask>
if it is to come from other eu states , then poverty is being shifted from one country to another , or it will not come at all <mask>

the causality of the rise of the fascist and communist regimes should therefore be sought in the misguided liberalisation of the economic system in the <mask>

that is because it <mask>
this situation is aggravated by the fact that the <mask>
the germans thus find themselves caught <mask>

i believe that they are still finding <mask>

so what specifically does a &quot; normal &quot; foreign policy entail , from a german <mask>

germany &apos;s economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other major powers and therefore <mask>
have these economic interests <mask>

i think that secretly , <mask>

does germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with israel and the usa on the one hand , and the position of its most <mask>

does germany view itself as playing the role of an important international player - does germany actually want to assume a leading <mask>

germany is still not used to it , the country continues to be <mask>

so the minute that a u.s. official says anything the least bit critical of mexico , you start hearing -- in the mexican press , and among the elites -- complaints about how the americans are encroaching upon <mask>

but i <mask>
first of all , like many people , i assumed that boredom was a relatively recent phenomenon , with the advent of more leisure <mask>
not so , says peter <mask>
&quot; boredom actually has a very long history , &quot; he <mask>
there &apos;s latin graffiti about boredom on the walls of <mask>
then there <mask>
the trouble is that it has been defined , and <mask>
after looking over the research literature and putting the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people , professor eastwood and <mask>
what separates boredom from apathy , he said , is that the person <mask>
with apathy , he said , there <mask>
the core experience of boredom , he said , is &quot; disruption of <mask>
boredom can sound <mask>
but professor eastwood said that while they can be related , <mask>
sometimes we think we &apos;re bored when we just <mask>
in their study , &quot; the unengaged mind : defining boredom in terms of attention , &quot; which appeared in the journal perspectives on psychological science in september , professor eastwood and his colleagues <mask>
some groups heard a loud and <mask>
the ones who heard the low ##at##-##at## level tv reported more boredom than the other two <mask>
when you &apos;re trying to focus on a difficult or engaging task , disruption of attention can lead to boredom , <mask>
on the other hand , when you &apos;re doing something dull , <mask>
in fact , he said , we now know that squirming and doodling , often seen as <mask>
&quot; research shows that kids who are allowed to fidget learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to <mask>
we all experience boredom at some points - my flight <mask>
but <mask>
to help measure this , researchers developed a <mask>
the scale includes questions like , &quot; many things i have to do are repetitive and monotonous , &quot; and &quot; i have so many interests , i <mask>
using such scales , researchers have discovered that boys tend to be bored more often than girls , said stephen vodanovich , a professor of psychology at the <mask>
but in general , teenagers <mask>
in 1991 , reed larson , a professor of human and community development at the university of illinois , conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times <mask>
he found that 32 percent of adolescents said they were bored in school and doing homework , while 23 percent said they were <mask>
on the other hand , 3 percent of parents <mask>
professor larson <mask>
but he said he did know that &quot; adolescence is a peak period for boredom , &quot; largely because children and teenagers are not given a lot <mask>
so <mask>
sometimes no , because in its extreme it can lead people <mask>
on the other hand , many philosophers and writers discuss the connection between boredom and creativity , said professor vodanovich , <mask>
&quot; boredom is the brain &apos;s way to tell you you should be doing something else , &quot; said gary marcus , <mask>
but the brain doesn &apos;t always know the most <mask>
if you &apos;re bored and use that energy <mask>
but if you watch <mask>
so if your child is bored and you give him an ipad , he may not be bored anymore <mask>

your kid doesn &apos;t just learn to entertain himself , but <mask>
i don &apos;t think we really want <mask>
nor should we <mask>
rather , our goal <mask>
professor <mask>
&quot; we frame it as we need to be bored more , but boredom is an agonizing , restless desire to <mask>
what people are really searching for , <mask>

he added that , at the time , &quot; he had reasonable suspicion that assange would be extradited to another country <mask>

what there is , is the danger that his physical and mental health may deteriorate due to being locked in a small space <mask>

in that regard , he welcomed the fact that it was no <mask>
correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on paraguay in unasur , at least until their next elections , arguing that the body &quot; must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and a coup masked with legality <mask>
the ecuadorian president also considered the &quot; perfectly pertinent &quot; desire of his colombian counterpart , juan manuel santos , to now negotiate with nicaragua the maritime boundary <mask>

basketball globetrotter hector &quot; hetin &quot; reyes was involved in the sport for over 60 years and <mask>
few people in puerto rico have a mental recollection of <mask>
reyes was immersed in the sport <mask>
