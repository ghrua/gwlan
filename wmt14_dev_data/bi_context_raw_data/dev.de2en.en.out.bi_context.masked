a republican <mask> election of obama
republican leaders justified their policy by the need to <mask> .
however , the brennan centre considers this a myth <mask> in the united states than the number of people killed by lightning .
indeed , republican lawyers identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the united states in a <mask> .
one thing is certain : these new provisions will have a negative impact on <mask> ##at##-##at## out .
in <mask> undermine the american democratic system .
unlike in canada , the american states are responsible for the organisation of federal elections in <mask> states .
it is in this spirit that a majority of american governments have passed new laws since 2009 making <mask> more difficult .
this phenomenon gained momentum following the november 2010 elections , which saw 675 new republican representatives added in 26 <mask> .
as a result , 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 <mask> introduced in 2011 alone .
the new election laws require voters to show a photo id <mask> citizenship .
furthermore , these laws also reduce early voting periods , invalidate the right to register as a voter on election day and withdraw the <mask> .
before the 2006 elections , no us <mask> id card .
indiana was the first state <mask> such a requirement .
in 2008 , the supreme court of the <mask> indiana law .
the republican authorities were quick to extend this practice to other <mask> .
over <mask> force voters to show a photo id card .
it is important to note that , unlike quebec , american <mask> such as the health insurance card .
in fact , 11 % of american citizens , i.e. 21 million people of voting age , do not possess <mask> .
in addition <mask> voters in 2012 do not have such identification .
and it often costs over a hundred dollars to obtain the <mask> .
the new restrictions disproportionately <mask> minorities and people with low incomes .
in fact , 25 % of african americans , 15 % of those earning less than $ 35,000 ; 18 <mask> years old do not have the required photo id card .
and <mask> &apos;s not all .
students , voters <mask> several states to use the photo id card issued by their institution .
on the other hand , these same states allow fishing or hunting club members , who <mask> to use the cards issued by these clubs when they vote .
prior to 2004 , no state required proof <mask> vote .
arizona <mask> such a requirement .
since 2011 , a <mask> voters to prove they are american citizens .
these measures are clearly intended <mask> the hispanic vote .
however , it appears that two out of three hispanic voters <mask> party .
what is more , in 2011 republican legislators sponsored laws <mask> .
in addition , they limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to <mask> to register .
these restrictions <mask> consequence .
for example , during the 2004 general election , <mask> 10 million citizens .
however , the measures adopted since 2009 have led to a 17 % drop in the registration <mask> to 2006 .
in addition , republican legislators have enacted laws in five <mask> reducing the early voting period .
for example , during the 2008 <mask> % of early voters were african ##at##-##at## americans , who accounted however for only 13 % of voters in the state .
the <mask> .
these represented only 11 % of voters , but 24 % of citizens who voted <mask> .
on the other hand , 76 <mask> white but these represented only 46 % of early voters .
of course , democratic legislators and <mask> the adoption of laws restricting voter registration .
several bills <mask> of democratic governors .
the united states attorney general intervened to <mask> most controversial laws .
they were able <mask> .
for example , only 16 out of <mask> presentation of a photo id card .
however , the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult <mask> in 2012 .
democratic critics denounce the partisan character of the laws that have been passed and they see a clear <mask> the 2012 results in key states .
a 2011 brennan centre report shows that <mask> laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to win the presidency .
it is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have significant impacts on the <mask> elections .
but one thing is certain : these new provisions will have <mask> out .
in this sense , the measures will partially undermine the american democratic <mask> .
prostate cancer screening : <mask> not ?
indeed , the psa test <mask> false negative or even false positive results , which involve unnecessary medical interventions .
enough <mask> men hesitate to take screening tests .
take the <mask> or not ?
we <mask> two specialists for their opinion .
in studies conducted in <mask> a lot of contamination between control groups , so it is difficult to interpret the data and make firm recommendations .
another study , this time a european one , concluded that there was a difference in mortality <mask> patients who were screened and those who were not .
this study also showed , with a follow ##at##-##at## up after <mask> between 30 and 40 % more likely for metastases to occur in the absence of screening .
i therefore recommend the test from age 50 , or 40 if you have a <mask> who previously had prostate cancer .
african ##at##-##at## american men are also <mask> .
the key is to make the <mask> decision once cancer has been detected .
there are aggressive cancers and others that <mask> .
the patient really needs <mask> cancer , by offering him the options available , not necessarily treating prostate cancers that are not long ##at##-##at## term life threatening , and opting instead , in such cases , for active monitoring of the disease .
today , many men in whom cancer has been detected will not <mask> life threatening .
active monitoring will be suggested , and if the disease progresses , they will <mask> .
more and more , specific criteria are being determined in order to decide who <mask> .
therefore i recommend taking <mask> .
but the important thing is to have a discussion with your <mask> .
in collaboration with the <mask> and cons of the psa test .

preventing <mask> disease
unfortunately , there is no miracle <mask> for preventing cancer .
despite the progress in research , the adoption of healthy living habits remains the best way to reduce the risk <mask> from it .
it <mask> and exercised enough , 30 % of cancers could be prevented .
&quot; if no more people smoked , this rate would increase to <mask> % , &quot; says andré beaulieu , spokesman for the canadian cancer society .
on the other hand , it is estimated <mask> are hereditary .
some are also <mask> .
for <mask> tobacco remains a priority , despite the decrease in the number of smokers .
cigarettes are <mask> lung cancer cases .
it is also a risk factor for <mask> .
this massively damages people &apos;s <mask> .
&quot; <mask> million smokers in quebec &quot; deplores spokesperson andré beaulieu .
encouraging data : 10 years after giving up smoking , <mask> cancer drops by half .
overweight and obesity are also conducive to the onset of the disease <mask> scc .
they can increase the risks of cancer <mask> uterus .
&quot; research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout <mask> also said .
the organisation also recommends <mask> .
in large amounts , it increases the risks of <mask> cancer .
likewise , so do cured meat products , and these <mask> avoided .
the conservation of meat by smoking <mask> curing can cause the formation of carcinogens .
&quot; they can damage cells in the body and lead to the <mask> it is explained .
in recent years , <mask> vitamin supplements and cancer .
for the time being however <mask> .
studies on vitamin <mask> scc .
while one study noted a decrease in the risk of <mask> another noted an increase .
also the effect of vitamin d on <mask> not clear .
in addition , mr beaulieu emphasises the importance of discussing your concerns and family history <mask> .
&quot; taking a screening test doesn <mask> you cancer . &quot;
the higgs <mask> revealed
the announcement of the probable discovery of the <mask> boson created quite a stir last summer , and with good reason .
indeed , it is believed that <mask> part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the universe , no less .
also it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the standard model - our best or &quot; less <mask> behaviour of matter - but which has not yet been observed empirically .
but <mask> sure that it really is the higgs .
we know without a shadow of a doubt that it is a new authentic particle , and <mask> higgs boson predicted by the standard model .
in addition <mask> to confirm this , but there are still insufficient data to be perfectly sure .
but let &apos;s suppose that it really is the higgs , since the chances of being mistaken seem slim , <mask> it is .
in our world , there is a fatally unavoidable law which states that two things cannot meet <mask> the same time .
there &apos;s no way to break this rule - and don &apos;t <mask> mad .
however , even though particle physics is a very strange world , it turns out that it also has a law <mask> pauli exclusion principle , which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same &quot; quantum state &quot; - this &quot; state &quot; consisting roughly of certain of their characteristics .
based on this , physicists classify <mask> categories .
in one corner we have good citizens called fermions , who wisely obey the pauli <mask> .
while lurking in the other are the bosons , a nasty band <mask> in the same place at the same time .
these bosons are then divided into two groups , according to the berkeley labs particle adventure site ( absolutely extraordinary , by the way ) : mesons , which we will not discuss here , and &quot; force particles &quot; by which the great forces of nature are propagated <mask> be somehow related .
these bosons , it must be stressed here , are not all such <mask> as you might think .
in fact , if you can read this article , it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson : the photon , or the &quot; light <mask> the electromagnetic force .
when , in fact , a particle having an electric charge accelerates or changes direction , this &quot; disturbs &quot; the electromagnetic field in this specific place , rather like <mask> .
this &quot; disturbance &quot; produces an electromagnetic wave ( <mask> etc . ) , and this wave is nothing other than a photon - and thus one of the &quot; force carrier &quot; bosons .
more <mask> field
the same applies to the higgs boson , with the difference that it is another field , the higgs field , <mask> boson to appear .
now , this higgs field is much , much more stable than the electromagnetic field ; to <mask> energy levels , rather like a frozen pond which would need a very large rock to wrinkle the surface .
which is why a huge particle accelerator like the one at cern - the <mask> 27km circumference ! - is needed to achieve such energy levels .
the analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful <mask> the relationship between the higgs and mass .
in fact not all particles , or all materials , interact with <mask> field .
some , such as magnets , do so , but others don &apos;t - a piece of paper , for example , will never stick to a <mask> .
and likewise , not all particles interact with the higgs field : <mask> the others ( such as the photon ) do not .
now , what is it <mask> bring &quot; ? asks ms plamondon .
for science , it serves to check the validity of the standard model ( sm ) , and also <mask> observations and predictions of the sm .
a number of people , <mask> because the slightest difference could open a door to a &quot; new physics &quot; and plug certain holes in the model .
this , it must be <mask> ! ) or dark matter , which forms approximately 80 % of the matter in the universe ( re ##at##-##at## oops ! ) .
but to date no such discrepancies have been <mask> cern .
the repercussions of this research on the daily life of the man in the street are more difficult to predict , but it would be wrong to assume <mask> won &apos;t be any .
remember : in the very early 60s , the pioneers of the laser at bell laboratories did not suspect the revolution that would be <mask> their work .
they had an inkling of the scientific applications , but <mask> the rest .
in fact , the late willard boyle - a physicist who worked at bell labs , where the laser was invented in 1960 , and who himself developed the first continuous laser ( the first were pulsed ) in 1962 - told us <mask> a &quot; lab gadget . &quot;
just <mask> ...
and then , applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds <mask> .
for example , the same willard boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969 , <mask> in optics .
this <mask> intention , now serves as an &quot; eye &quot; to all digital cameras worldwide , and earned him the nobel physics prize in 2009 .
this does not of course mean that the activities of the lhc will necessarily transform our lives , but it does mean that <mask> never know ...
palliative care - <mask> way to die ... &#124; le devoir
with its dying <mask> end of life .
the debate <mask> being prepared .
however , in this vital area , <mask> done .
le devoir <mask> look more closely .
just a few weeks ago mr l. lived <mask> montérégie apartment .
the <mask> a two ##at##-##at## year respite .
&quot; they gave me five years to live , i &apos;ve made it to seven , &quot; he says , with mixed emotions , lying in his bed at the victor ##at##-##at## gadbois palliative care home in beloeil , where he <mask> .
&quot; but it &apos;s still a <mask> for it &quot; he adds .
the disease <mask> weakness which prevents him going to the toilet alone , and even eating alone .
sitting in front of an appetising lunch , he <mask> , resigned .
courageous , he even manages to <mask> offering him a bath .
the courage of <mask> .
&quot; what <mask> be cured of my diarrhoea , it &apos;s humiliating &quot; he confided .
a few hours later , the team found a cure for <mask> illness .
&quot; during our lives , we <mask> , &quot; says pierre brodeur , psychologist at the victor ##at##-##at## gadbois home .
regressing to the stage of a child , <mask> is an unacceptable humiliation .
&quot; it depends on the person &apos;s <mask> regression , he says .
because , in the <mask> the very heart of such regression .
patients at the victor ##at##-##at## gadbois <mask> home all suffer from cancer .
they have a maximum life expectancy of three <mask> .
at this stage , the team of doctors and nurses surrounding them no longer provides so ##at##-##at## <mask> curative &quot; care .
for mrs <mask> the worst fear is to die &quot; conscious and suffocating . &quot;
but the disease has <mask> me discover my children .
&quot; i have fine children &quot; she <mask> .
&quot; i don <mask> having a mask put on to help her breathe .
she looks <mask> to a last visit by her son coming from italy .
at victor ##at##-##at## gadbois , a <mask> with feeding .
this is palliative care , given when there is nothing else that can <mask> .
to make <mask> .
in quebec , there are palliative <mask> inhabitants .
this is very few when we <mask> day .
here , life continues under the best possible conditions , explains dr christiane martel , one of the doctors at the <mask> .
whether at <mask> comfort , emotional or spiritual level .
a person who is dying will accept being helped to drink brandy or <mask> , whatever is their tipple .
diabetics no <mask> their blood sugar .
and <mask> is part of everyday life .
yesterday evening , a <mask> during the night .
this morning , it is his son who will finish <mask> deceased .
&quot; we help relatives as <mask> director of care .
at the victor ##at##-##at## <mask> but no two are alike .
along with a 93 ##at##-##at## year ##at##-##at## old man who is savouring his last meeting with his family , sitting firmly wedged in his pillows while toasts are drunk in his honour , a 36 ##at##-##at## year <mask> is dying tragically , surrounded by his parents , his wife and his two young children , after having tried everything to survive .
&quot; for six months , there have always been three to five <mask> concerned dr christiane martel .
53 % of patients admitted to the victor ##at##-##at## gadbois home come from their homes , 47 % from <mask> .
lack of access to <mask> care
it is said that 77 % of canadians simply have no access to palliative care , which is care designed to ease the pain when a patient has <mask> in hospital or in a care home .
and a number of organisations , <mask> the palliative care society in greater montreal , specialise more or less exclusively in care provided to cancer patients .
it is precisely this large gap in quebec health care which has made a number of palliative care <mask> suicide .
since october , a manifesto , signed by palliative care luminaries including dr balfour mount and dr bernard lapointe , has been <mask> their opposition to such an initiative .
according <mask> palliative care before it is accepted to proceed to euthanasia .
recently , she says , i <mask> days in emergency , in great pain , without anything being done to ease her suffering .
i &apos;m afraid that patients ask <mask> .
and at the same time , some oncologists work relentlessly on their patients until the last day , despite the <mask> prognoses .
hélène richard &apos;s survival hopes were <mask> ended her gruelling chemotherapy .
when i announced to my oncologist that i was stopping the treatment , she told me <mask> given up fighting , she said .
however , she <mask> finished !
no <mask> care
dr martel believes that 90 % of patients asking to die thank care ##at##-##at## givers for not having acceded to their request after they have been relieved of <mask> by a palliative care team .
but <mask> palliative care is not absolutely all ##at##-##at## powerful in the treatment of pain .
according to elsie monereau , palliative care director with the palliative care society in greater montreal , patients are resistant to treatment against <mask> of cases .
at the very end of life , physicians then often resort to palliative sedation , which is equivalent to putting the patient to sleep until the time of death , either sporadically or <mask> .
we can no longer <mask> this part of their suffering .
increasingly , an unrelieved patient will have the option of having such <mask> .
patients who are not relieved always say the same <mask> die . &quot;
but this does not necessarily mean &quot; i want <mask> means &quot; i want to be relieved . &quot;

widespread real <mask> quebec
day after day highway officials , building contractors , political party fund ##at##-##at## raisers and italian mafia specialists tell what <mask> system , &quot; combining the building industry , government officials , politicians , trade unionists and organised crime .
an &quot; industry &quot; which has cost quebec taxpayers dearly , <mask> the 1990s and 2000s .
&quot; it is curious how the system is crumbling since we took <mask> police .
it was through him that the scandal broke in 2011 , in an in ##at##-##at## depth investigation into corruption <mask> which the liberal prime minister at the time , jean charest , had consented only reluctantly .
the &quot; duchesneau report &quot; established a direct link <mask> ##at##-##at## the ##at##-##at## table financing of parties and bribery of officials .
&quot; since the inquiry opened in 2010 , he says , the ministry of transport alone reportedly <mask> certain people curbing their instincts to get a share !
the charbonneau commission &quot; has already brought down two mayors <mask> hoping that it will succeed in &quot; revealing the schemes behind the individuals . &quot;
a permanent <mask> ##at##-##at## corruption unit , created in 2011
the permanent anti ##at##-##at## corruption unit , created in 2011 , is also coupled with its army of government analysts <mask> .
plus the &quot; marteau squad &quot; policemen who , since 2009 , have apparently led the montreal &quot; sewer <mask> ...
in recent weeks , it has conducted a series of searches and brought <mask> municipal politicians , such as frank zampino and richard marcotte , mayor of a suburban town .
next on the list is apparently gilles vaillancourt , who has just resigned from his post as mayor <mask> largest city in quebec .
he is suspected of <mask> bribes in exchange for public contracts .
others formally <mask> accurso and lino zambito .
the latter caused a sensation by explaining the mechanics <mask> to the commission .
he himself paid 3 % of the value of the contracts obtained in montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who in turn paid the money to union montréal <mask> gérald tremblay &apos;s party .
mr zambito has handed <mask> roughly 68,000 euros ) to provincial parties , especially the liberals then in power .
he also admitted having organised an illegal fundraiser for former <mask> prime minister , nathalie normandeau .
sewer contracts <mask> costs
in montreal , the corruption &quot; system &quot; ran <mask> .
gilles surprenant , former public works engineer , described it in detail in front of the commission : in ten years , he received from construction companies gifts , invitations to trips , golf tournaments , restaurants , hockey matches and bribes totalling 736,000 dollars , <mask> he inflated the costs .
other highway officials admitted having their palms greased by inflating invoices by 30 to 40 % , and <mask> ons .
then an organiser of the mayor &apos;s party , martin dumont , accused mr tremblay of <mask> dirty money .
following these <mask> in early november , plunging montreal into a major crisis .
chantal rouleau <mask> the first women in montreal to raise the alarm .
mayor of the borough of rivière ##at##-##at## des ##at##-##at## prairies , to the east of the island , she protested in 2010 against the sale of municipal land <mask> estate boom .
70 % dirty money in <mask> campaigns
on the investigation which will <mask> how the system - infiltrated by ants - works , to put a stop to the gangrene and catch the culprits . &quot;
the process , she says , is <mask> but positive . &quot;
the wound is being cleaned , but <mask> , to avoid the return of these questionable practices .
how <mask> .
jacques duchesneau notes for his part that &quot; officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars , &quot; but he is especially concerned about <mask> the scam !
estimating the share of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in quebec at 70 % , he says dryly : &quot; i was told that it was only a pale reflection of <mask> . &quot;
the quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to 100 dollars , but this will not change the situation <mask> expenses are strictly limited , there will be dirty money in politics . &quot;
he advocates a complete overhaul of the system for granting public contracts and party funding : &quot; we can &apos;t go any lower ; getting to the bottom of things , with courage , <mask> to rebuild the house on more solid foundations , with more controls and laws . &quot;
although this story tarnishes the international image of quebec and <mask> invites anyone laughing to look in their own backyard ...
&quot; psg is not fc <mask> ! &quot;
this season , you have <mask> .
how do you explain this <mask> ?
it can be explained by individual awareness <mask> by the new dimension of psg .
some <mask> arrived .
every day i <mask> .
the technical staff <mask> brought me a lot .
day by day , all these things help me raise my level of <mask> .
and , in a match , it <mask> .
everything moves very fast in <mask> .
but i don &apos;t get <mask> up .
from my debut at the clairefontaine inf pre ##at##-##at## training centre to my transfer to saint ##at##-##at## etienne , i &apos;ve always <mask> step .
so you benefit from the competition brought in <mask> ancelotti ...
this summer &apos;s recruits are used to playing matches at a <mask> .
they also know that every <mask> session is crucial .
which is what makes a player like me want to face up and <mask> .
on the other hand , carlo ancelotti gives me a lot <mask> .
he &apos;s supported by deputies like claude makelele , who played in <mask> .
is <mask> the job ?
ancelotti inspires respect among all the <mask> .
today he has no equal in ligue 1 , and he &apos;s one of the <mask> in europe .
he has masses of experience and has won many titles <mask> .
he &apos;s <mask> .
i think he will bring more titles to <mask> .
in january , i <mask> him .
i was just coming <mask> series of injuries .
the confidence he gives me <mask> explains my performance .
what importance do you attach to the first part <mask> ?
in ligue 1 , <mask> top .
but <mask> the sidelines .
one of our main goals is the champions league : <mask> for the last 16 in the right way .
what is the club &apos;s goal in this <mask> ?
we &apos;ll try to go as far <mask> .
from now on <mask> can happen .
but we &apos;ll have something <mask> some very good european teams .
first of all , we want to finish top in our pool , ahead of porto , to have <mask> in the last 16 match .
can psg become a top european club in the <mask> term ?
it <mask> ...
to become a top european club , paris needs to win titles and <mask> .
today , <mask> the case .
financially , psg has the <mask> it happen .
in ligue 1 , would not winning the <mask> , be a big failure ?
definitely , it <mask> .
this <mask> championship .
we weren &apos;t far <mask> season .
in may , <mask> were good enough to finish first .
it was a <mask> .
we finished with <mask> .
normally <mask> top ...
but another team , montpellier , had an even more fantastic <mask> .
i think <mask> .
even if big teams like <mask> weapons to win .
do you <mask> psg ?
it &apos;s normal for <mask> from us given what &apos;s been invested and the players we have .
we <mask> it .
after we won 4 ##at##-##at## 0 at home against troyes and <mask> definitely a bit frustrating .
you wonder <mask> expect .
you <mask> going to win 4 ##at##-##at## 0 every weekend .
we &apos;re not fc <mask> !
we &apos;re trying to implement a game <mask> .
it takes <mask> to build a team .
the champions league proved we could <mask> our own .
look at manchester city who , for two seasons , have failed to qualify for the <mask> , despite also having spent huge amounts !
based on the amounts invested , <mask> the winter break !
that would be to ignore our opponents and the <mask> championship .
lyon and marseille , who were no good last season , were &quot; <mask> by the new psg .
this shows that ligue 1 is <mask> .
i hope that in may we will be able to smile in saying that , despite all the <mask> .
psg seem totally dependent on the exploits <mask> ibrahimovic .
so much so that people <mask> &quot; zlatan dependence . &quot;
this means ibrahimovic is <mask> lot of goals .
that &apos;s why he came , and he &apos;s proving he &apos;s the star <mask> .
he &apos;s demonstrated everywhere he went that he was a great player , a <mask> .
within the group , <mask> and the player .
and <mask> respects the men he has around him .
what he has done is truly <mask> .
it pushes others to raise their level <mask> .
thiago silva , who is <mask> progress .
how did you get on in euro 2012 with the <mask> ?
a <mask> .
i really wanted <mask> in this euro .
unfortunately , my injury prevented me from <mask> any game time .
i saw some things there and came out <mask> .
today <mask> in selection matches .
which <mask> with the blues .
i &apos;ve learned the lessons from what happened in the ukraine and i now <mask> .
what do think about didier deschamps &apos;s first <mask> blues ?
he has the <mask> .
we &apos;re well placed in the world <mask> group .
the <mask> and inspires them to win .
like laurent <mask> was .
but i don &apos;t want to make any <mask> .
blanc had achieved his goal when <mask> the euro .
i hope didier deschamps will take the <mask> .
did the good draw ( 1 ##at##-##at## 1 ) snatched in spain , on 16 october , represent <mask> ?
that <mask> gave us confidence .
everybody fought <mask> .
before that <mask> match in my career .
with bitcoin , pay and sell <mask> banks
the opposite of current monetary exchanges , <mask> identified transactions and processing fees among the parties involved .
in addition , as <mask> these technologies , a political vision is palpable : the belief that the current monetary system , made up of banking monopolies , leads to financial crises .
in fact , bitcoin , invented by satoshi nakamoto ( a pseudonym ) , is both a virtual currency ( but convertible into dollars , euros ) and a secure exchange protocol like bittorrent , which allows <mask> ##at##-##at## to ##at##-##at## peer file exchange .
around 200,000 transactions have already been recorded via 15,000 computers on <mask> .
close to a thousand web sites <mask> donations or means of payment .
the bitcoin exchange rate , after reaching a peak of 30 dollars ( 23 euros ) in june 2011 , fell to 2 dollars five months later , returning today to around a dozen dollars ( rates are listed on the bitcoincharts.com <mask> .
nothing very impressive , compared to <mask> in real currency or financial products .
however , the european central bank ( ecb ) took an interest in it in a report on virtual <mask> .
it describes bitcoin as &quot; the most successful virtual currency , &quot; &quot; in competition with the dollar or <mask> conventional currencies . &quot;
bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currency such as &apos; credits &apos; , used to progress in a video game which you win by playing or which you can buy ( and <mask> return ) .
the social network facebook has also developed this kind of <mask> .
but , on each occasion , a <mask> handles the exchanges .
with bitcoin , all nodes in the network are both custodians of the book of accounts , auditors , currency issuers , <mask> sellers .
how does the network <mask> ?
each transaction between <mask> like with an e ##at##-##at## mail .
except that a user can <mask> a different address for each payment , thereby ensuring anonymity .
a set of information associated <mask> encryption system .
so the network can <mask> transaction .
using the contents of the file , it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in the <mask> .
the <mask> book .
it passes through the resolution of a <mask> to the computers , and the winner , a kind of interim central banker , will have the privilege of adding this extra line .
this is a file hashing phase , i.e. the transformation of a large <mask> shorter and unique digital imprint .
computers &quot; take &quot; the new transaction and add a <mask> all up .
the goal being to find the number that <mask> zeros at the beginning ) .
once <mask> check that it is the right one .
the transaction is <mask> chain of all the other transactions ; any modification would alter the imprint .
if a user wanted to defraud by paying twice with the same <mask> the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other would remain an orphan because the two have different imprints .
the <mask> 50 bitcoins .
to avoid inflation , this award <mask> by the end of 2012 .
the number of bitcoins <mask> is therefore limited to 21 million , but they are divisible down to the hundred millionth , which leaves some margin ...
the difficulty of the challenge is <mask> in computing power .
the life of <mask> had its ups and downs .
websites providing services for bitcoin have been <mask> stolen .
&quot; the loophole used is not the protocol itself <mask> bitcoin network .
the ecb also highlights the possibilities of <mask> using this anonymous service .
but cash also <mask> weakness .
major players like wikipedia refuse donations of <mask> nature .
others , such <mask> them .
recently , adi shamir and dorit ron , from the weizmann institute in israel , analysed the accounting books and showed that <mask> 80 % of bitcoins do not circulate .
in <mask> &quot; huge sell ##at##-##at## offs &quot; were launched .

we got out <mask> .
what <mask> ?
french troops have left their <mask> afghanistan ( kapisa and surobi ) .
nato <mask> to follow in late 2014 .
it is time for the afghan army to resume possession of its <mask> .
it is mainly afghan peasants that we have <mask> regarding them as terrorists .
and ourselves , with our 88 soldiers killed , plus the <mask> the maimed .
the taliban is composed of foreign extremists , former leaders in refuge in pakistan , but often <mask> forces , like in the time of the soviets .
they <mask> , even though they have been joined by jihadists , pakistanis , arabs , uzbeks , tajiks .
tolerated , sometimes assisted , by local insurgents , the latter will no longer be so when westerners <mask> more scarce .
the departure of french troops from the nijrab base , which i observed from the top of hills of almond trees planted with french funding <mask> out in an orderly fashion .
convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles reached <mask> helicopters .
there will be no wave of the <mask> 2014 .
circumstances <mask> 1994 and 1996 .
at that time kabul was empty , the <mask> the struggles between different factions .
their takeover <mask> had been perceived then as a sort of liberation , a return to safety .
afghanis paid the price of the obscurantism of these peasants by the organisation of <mask> .
former mujahidin , the afghan government and the current taliban are <mask> in an inferior position .
the main anti ##at##-##at## soviet war leaders returned to <mask> .
they became profiteers , seizing government land to resell as building land to refugees returning from iran and <mask> .
they have become discredited <mask> more , most of them did not fight themselves .
the people , as i heard in the countryside , want a government <mask> of thieves .
many young people want to leave , as those who were able to benefit from <mask> is considerable .
the young <mask> and its ideologies .
they have rubbed <mask> their exile in iran or pakistan , and appreciated the benefits .
roughly 65 % of the population <mask> 25 ; kabul now has 5 million people , a fifth of the total population .
in towns and cities , the state schools <mask> .
it will be necessary to provide work for those young people who no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or the corruption of certain <mask> .
all of them , including the armed opponents , are partial to mobile <mask> turkish soap operas that show a modern world , is followed everywhere .
the army is <mask> .
will the authorities who command it be <mask> legitimate ?
former commanders of the anti ##at##-##at## soviet struggle are already thinking about restoring <mask> , which will escape the central power .
afghanistan , land of mountains , with strong local identities , should be able to benefit from a certain decentralisation , in the image of <mask> , with strong presidential power , abolishing the post of prime minister , which had existed since the 1964 constitution .
president karzai does not want any foreign controls , particularly on the <mask> 2014 .
but , since the 50s and already well before , his country has been dependent <mask> .
no industries <mask> no dams are in good condition , no major irrigation systems have been repaired .
everything is <mask> apart from fruit and vegetables .
the priority is <mask> initiative .
in a country ruined by thirty years of war , government control over the infrastructure would have been <mask> .
the rumour was spread that afghanistan had <mask> .
this only <mask> westerners were only there to seize it .
with no energy to process the iron ore or <mask> no mining .
the chinese have already almost left the mes aynak copper mine , leaving international archaeologists ( funded by <mask> huge buddhist site and remain the largest employers in the province .
one day it will also be necessary for afghanistan and pakistan , on which imports and exports <mask> to restore normal relations .
the departure of french combat troops was completed on <mask> .
the new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid : girls &apos; high school , boys &apos; high school , french department at the university , french institute , cooperation in the <mask> medical and agricultural fields , support to the archaeological delegation .
since 2009 , to try to &quot; win hearts and minds &quot; and achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions , a &quot; civil ##at##-##at## military actions &quot; service from the ministry of defence ( cimic ) , closed in 2012 , has carried out , and continues to carry out successfully , through a <mask> agricultural rehabilitation projects in dozens of mountain villages .
these projects , involving large numbers of local labour , have helped to contain the insurgency : irrigation , wells , drinking <mask> areas .
what will we leave as <mask> billion euros of military spending ?
a much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions , which are very hard in these valleys often <mask> metres above sea level .
the embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from local communities in kapisa <mask> .
to be in a position to free themselves from the uprising led by foreign groups , which is what farmers told me they want , a small amount of civil aid should <mask> well controlled and directly affecting them .
a constitution by <mask> egypt
a new gamble for president <mask> morsi .
while egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration <mask> grants him full powers , he has decided to go for broke .
taking everyone by surprise , he announced on wednesday that the constituent assembly would vote on its final <mask> the following day .
just a week ago , the head of state had given the assembly two <mask> months to finish its work .
for two years egypt has relied on a provisional text , amended several times and this has weakened institutional stability and led to <mask> .
this <mask> served to enhance the divide in the country .
according to his <mask> his &quot; autocratic delirium , &quot; continuing to &quot; go back on his word &quot; and &apos; trample the law . &quot;
his supporters affirm that this is the quickest way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis , by <mask> process .
a referendum is due to be held within the next two <mask> .
a very short period , which forces the brothers to abandon their <mask> text , article by article , to the egyptians .
for the <mask> a way to achieve popular and democratic legitimacy while the dispute rages throughout the country .
mohammed morsi seems convinced that egyptians will vote favourably , as <mask> an interview with the american weekly time .
particularly since a hasty vote smacks of an ultimatum to the egyptian people : <mask> supposedly expiring following adoption of the constitution .
it <mask> islamist majority , voted on the text yesterday .
most of the liberals were <mask> .
in mid ##at##-##at## november , shortly before the constitutional declaration , they <mask> to assert their views .
representatives of human rights , religious minorities or civil society had <mask> likewise .
in order to obtain a quorum , 11 members , alternates , were hastily <mask> yesterday morning .
some of them are <mask> to the muslim brotherhood .
not <mask> , the articles were for the most part voted unanimously .
commentators were also amused that one of the only diversions of the day was expressed with regard to ... the hour of prayer , some committee <mask> that the constituent assembly clock was wrong .
the text , which was still being <mask> .
the main focus <mask> that of the 1971 constitution , stipulating that &quot; the principles of sharia are the main source of law . &quot;
the salafist parties , for which the establishment of islamic law is a major claim , were hoping to replace &quot; the principles &quot; by &quot; the rules , &quot; <mask> have allowed stricter application .
for the islamists , the fact that <mask> of egyptian society .
&quot; hypocrisy &quot; respond <mask> .
because in their opinion islamisation of the constitution is done through <mask> .
they refer in particular to article 220 , which grants al ##at##-##at## azhar university an advisory role , with particular reference to verifying the conformity of <mask> sharia .
according to egypt specialist sophie pommier , this is worrying because <mask> have no democratic legitimacy .
this <mask> &quot;
the liberals &apos; fears are also fuelled by the fact that the next rector of the university will probably be <mask> current one .
&quot; for <mask> religious implication .
with this constitution , things <mask> civil rule .
most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not islamic law scholars but academics , some trained in the french system &quot; qualifies alexis blouet , who is writing a thesis on the <mask> transition .
but he acknowledges that &quot; there may be some ambiguity <mask> because the terms used borrow from the religious vocabulary .
reference is <mask> editor &apos;s note &#93; .
and the question could be asked in future to what extent civil <mask> competent to pronounce on it . &quot;
beyond its religious aspect , the text voted on yesterday is highly criticised due to the extensive powers it grants to the <mask> of the republic .
the muslim brothers argue that they <mask> the former regime .
another issue : the powers <mask> on the army .
in accordance with the wishes of the military , the <mask> parliament , but to a national defence council .
nor will trials of civilians will be banned <mask> , as requested by associations for the defence of human rights .
who also voice <mask> .
the offence of blasphemy is maintained and insults are now prohibited , which could <mask> on freedom of expression , particularly for the press .
in addition , no longer does any of the articles refer to the protection of women , highlights heba morayef , <mask> .
in her opinion , the only positive point is the <mask> torture in article 36 .
the word was not included in the previous <mask> .

only the &quot; high and mighty &quot; make it to moscow : migrants <mask> language
while deputies and human rights activists argue <mask> sell fake certificates .
every year , 13 million migrant <mask> cities in russia .
mostly <mask> : uzbekistan , tajikistan and turkmenistan .
their only goal is to earn money to support <mask> home .
a new law came <mask> language test .
for the moment , this law applies only to those who intend to work in services , housing and utility <mask> retail .
but with <mask> service - tests will become mandatory for all non ##at##-##at## residents .
in addition to language , russian history and basics <mask> the legal system will be tested .
language knowledge will have to be confirmed both to receive <mask> permit .
an <mask> citizens of countries where russian is a state language .
people who received education certificates and diplomas before the fall of the <mask> exempt under the law .
purpose , doomed <mask> of rights
seven testing points will be operating under the auspices of the pushkin institute of russian language , peoples &apos; friendship university of russia , moscow <mask> institutions .
migrants can take the tests in all cities ; more than 160 such centres have been <mask> .
the initiative to introduce the testing was supported by state duma members and the federal <mask> .
but human rights activists , asked the question repeatedly in the <mask> before the law came into force : what will it actually achieve ?
what will the obligation to know russian change for the russians and for the non <mask> ?
first of all , according to representatives of the <mask> allow to reduce the number of people suffering from labour slavery .
many speak about protection of the rights of work migrants , explains the head of the representative office of the federal <mask> russia , viktor sebelev .
rights protection <mask> their departure .
only the system of <mask> the problems of foreign workers .
migrants without profession , <mask> start to have problems .

we receive many complaints from <mask> .

not be <mask> , boss !
nonetheless , <mask> to go to work in russia , admit that not only their understanding of the language of the country where they are going is not good , but they can barely write in their own language .
naturally , this is not so much their fault , but due to poverty : very few turks <mask> tajiks can afford even a basic education .
their families don &apos;t even have <mask> to feed their children , not to mention decent clothing , shoes , and supplies .
after reaching adolescence , these kids go to <mask> the first opportunity .
it is hard , if language <mask> bad , they admit .
&quot; you feel <mask> . &quot;
but human rights activists note one important point about the law <mask> .
testing will <mask> have legal status .
if they have no status , there will <mask> , nor any official work in the future .
in the meantime , most <mask> to live in russia illegally .
&quot; welcome , or <mask> &quot;
many of the foreigners <mask> easy .
the reason lies in <mask> difficulties .
in addition , <mask> money : from 12,000 to 16,000 rubles .
whereas a fake registration is done quickly <mask> only one and a half thousand .
officers of the russian police <mask> that we mainly have fake papers , without registration , hence the extortion .
&quot; they ask for <mask> , &quot; umed khushkadamov , a citizen of tajikistan , shared with journalists .
&quot; roll up , don <mask> artwork &quot;
on the first day of the law &apos;s entry into effect it turned out that <mask> migrant registration documents can be fake .
a few forged certificates about passing language tests have been <mask> already .
forged documents are <mask> printer .
naturally , they were not free for their owners : each of the migrants , who had hoped to facilitate the task of passing the tests in this way paid seven thousand rubles for <mask> .
it is two and a half times more than the process <mask> costs three thousand .
government officials and human <mask> corruption , so that the certificates could not just be bought .
for the moment , the authorities can promise migrant workers who could not pass the test the first time to give time to complete a <mask> course .
in addition , those who come <mask> russian language knowledge will be offered work in areas that do not require active communication with people .
the ministry of <mask> illegal market back into circulation

this is the reaction of authorities to recent incidents : click shots <mask> resulting in click the death of seven people .
policemen want to prohibit the carrying of weapons in public places and raise the <mask> 18 to 21 .
the idea was supported by the head of the duma committee on safety and anti ##at##-##at## corruption , irina yarovaya , who promised that the amendments to the law on weapons will be brought to the <mask> duma in the near future .
not everyone is happy that the russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by <mask> &quot;

&quot; like in a <mask> store &quot;
the buyer and seller often find each other <mask> .

actions are being supported by unions and a <mask> left ##at##-##at## wing organizations .
in addition to increasing the low wages received by employees of walmart and fast food chains , the goal <mask> is to create unions within them .
this sector of the economy <mask> .
46 cents a <mask> ?
actions began last week after thanksgiving , on <mask> friday , when massive sales drew millions of people in america , sometimes accompanied by clashes .
on this day , some employees of the walmart corporation , which employs 2.2 million people around the world , left their workplaces and picketed together with the unions and left ##at##-##at## wing activists from the corporation stores that sell products to people on low ##at##-##at## <mask> incomes .
walmart sells everything imaginable , from diapers , hunting rifles and car batteries , to vacuum cleaners , eggs and <mask> .
products in its <mask> than in major supermarkets .
so many low <mask> shop only at their workplace .
availability and assortment made walmart one of the biggest american <mask> .
according to critics , walmart can afford <mask> little to its employees .
these <mask> about hard work conditions , for example lack of lift trucks and hand ##at##-##at## held scanners .
protesters on black friday demanded <mask> cost of medical insurance provided by the corporation went from 30 to 100 dollars a month .
a typical walmart employee , <mask> / hour , cannot afford this .
scientists from the berkeley university in california argue that if walmart raises the average salary to 12 dollars / hour , it will cost the <mask> .
this is about 1.1 % more <mask> on salaries right now .
if walmart fully shifts the cost of increasing wages to the shoulders of consumers , each visit to the store will cost only 46 <mask> more .
in one year , <mask> more than now .
walmart <mask> cause any damage at all to the corporation .
black friday continued in its stores from 8 in the evening on thursday till midnight the <mask> walmart sold about 5000 products a second .
in total , its cash registers <mask> transactions on black friday .
representative of the corporation , dan fogelman , asserted in an interview with a left ##at##-##at## wing site , the huffington post , that a total of &quot; less than five &quot; walmart employees left the workplace , and the protest act was just &quot; another pr <mask> the union that organized it .
&quot; <mask> register ! &quot;
protests continued this week in new york , where their object was not walmart ( they &apos;re not so welcome in the progressive city , that is <mask> , but mcdonald &apos;s and other cheap restaurants .
mcdonald &apos;s says that it sells billions of portions , and despite this it doesn &apos;t even give you <mask> pay you for honest work !
jumaane williams , <mask> of new york
at <mask> federal and ny law is 7.25 dollars an hour .
fast food restaurants increase it with time , but very <mask> earn 8.90 dollars / hour .
nobody earns less <mask> .
i cannot understand how one can survive in new york on this <mask> .
once upon a time , almost a fourth of american teenagers went through mcdonald &apos;s , working part <mask> after school , living with parents .
few saw this as a <mask> planned to stay there for long .
now i continuously come across interviews with mcdonald &apos;s employees , who complain that they have to survive on this salary and <mask> children .
on the other hand , <mask> do not know how you will feed them .
participants of the protest that began at 6.30 a.m. on thursday near <mask> fast food chain be paid at least 15 dollars / hour , i.e. more than double their present wages .
they also demanded the creation of unions <mask> food industry .
american law prohibits the administration <mask> this or punishing activists of the union movement by nagging or firing .
on the other hand , <mask> their life .
but for objective reasons it is hard to cover fast food with a <mask> .
one of them is the unusual turnover <mask> .
noisy protests began on this day in a number of other cheap <mask> in manhattan .
the highlight of the action was the afternoon meeting near mcdonald &apos;s by times square , where several local democratic politicians spoke out . one of them , jumaane williams , said : &quot; mcdonald &apos;s claims it sells billions of portions , and despite this it doesn &apos;t even <mask> days or pay you for honest work ! &quot;
demonstrators were supported by other prominent ny democrats , like bill de blasio , a candidate for ny city mayor , who said : <mask> &quot;
according to the new york times , this was the biggest action of this kind <mask> food industry .
but only a few hundred <mask> thousands of people in new york .
it is unclear right now whether this will spark a mass <mask> .
&quot; at the moment , the mind cannot <mask> too well &quot;
among modern technology fans a popular topic <mask> special glasses .
at first , a functional model was shown by <mask> summer , at its annual conference . then , in november , it was announced that microsoft filed an application for patent too .
however , according to the conversation with the leader of the group of interactive 3d technologies in the cambridge laboratory of microsoft , shahram izadi , glasses are a thing of the past for scientists in <mask> .
they are drawn by the prospect of <mask> open spaces .
- please <mask> group does .
- we work on the interaction of people with machines , at the same time trying to expand the boundaries of this <mask> .
while <mask> pixels on a flat screen and sometimes pointing fingers at them .
we want to look 5 ##at##-##at## 10 <mask> cardinal changes in this interaction .
for example , xbox and kinect sensors are a step forward . almost no xbox is sold without kinect today <mask> .
- <mask> in the future ?
- despite the fact that kinect shifted the interaction to the physical level <mask> 3d .
information <mask> ( the system receives more data ) , but output still needs to get better .
we are trying to <mask> on various technologies , including projection technologies .
we need to let the computer world into our physical world , <mask> tangible .
but for <mask> user and the space around him .
then we will be able to supplement the real world with virtual objects in <mask> .
above all , get <mask> stupid virtual reality helmets !
- <mask> think about voice control ?
it <mask> , but is it overestimated ?
- it clearly cannot be called a cure ##at##-##at## for ##at##-##at## all - there &apos;s a question of privacy , because we do not always want to let <mask> about our actions and intentions .
in reality , <mask> , but each in their own niche .
for example , we had a project to control devices in public places , in which we thought about movements , not wide movements , but small , reserved <mask> .
movements were not <mask> of bones and muscles .
it &apos;s big <mask> reduced to the size of a hand watch .
in <mask> mixed control , e.g. movement + voice .
- <mask> you mean ?
- for example , how would you ask me <mask> water ?
you will talk and <mask> time .
- usually i <mask> .
- oh , that <mask> detect .
- so you <mask> at that moment ?
- not necessarily , but it is a mutual <mask> .
i <mask> on developing new sensors that will enable more precise determination of a person &apos;s reaction .
this could be , e.g. laser sensors . they have a decent depth resolution , <mask> very important .
- if we talk about your work with xbox kinect <mask> modern cameras ?
not enough resolution , depth <mask> ?
- in general , the current generation is what we can base ourselves <mask> three ##at##-##at## dimensional recognition .
of <mask> 1000 k / s speed .
it &apos;s not just the mega pixels , though , but the quality of the matrix and <mask> .
from the latter point <mask> not good enough for us - this adds work to the algorithm designers .
so it &apos;s important to remember about the resolution on the x , y , <mask> .
speed , <mask> also very important .
human movements are relatively dynamic , and the current 30 k / s <mask> especially for gestures .
steven bathiche from our redmond laboratory created a touch sensor with a regulated processing delay from 1 to 100 ms , while modern serial sensors <mask> to the latter indicator ( 60 ##at##-##at## 100 ) .
not everyone understands how this affects the <mask> and machine .
in my work , it would be very useful to have a device that does not require touching and would have more <mask> .
- does the <mask> ?
- in kinect there are three cameras now , one of <mask> recipient of the signal .
the third one is actually a regular sensor of <mask> range .
it is <mask> determine the object &apos;s depth .
potentially , <mask> could solve the problem ...
or make it worse , by increasing the required volume of <mask> .
it would be nice to create a flexible analogue kinect , <mask> flexion of camera disposition and see how this will help in three ##at##-##at## dimensional determination of the position .
- as far as i remember , microsoft did not present its glasses to the <mask> .
don &apos;t you think this <mask> point of view the everyday use of augmented reality technologies ?
- certainly it is not very convenient to walk <mask> your raised hands all the time , but i think that the coolest option would be &quot; transitional &quot; augmented reality , where you could shift from glasses to smart phone , projection display , and everywhere else based on a cloud platform .
glasses are a very personal device , that is their <mask> , at the same time , their weakness - augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people .
- let us imagine for a minute that manipulation of <mask> only to tony stark from ironman , but to a regular person .
there is one problem with <mask> that the critics often point out : no tactile feedback !
hands feel <mask> !
what answers does your group prepare to <mask> ?
- in my lectures i often say that augmented reality is the seventh consecutive attempt at the interaction between man and <mask> .
i <mask> the eighth will probably be the addition of tactile sensations .
for now <mask> of matrix for the image .
it is great at registering <mask> !
but there are technologies that are really aimed at giving these &quot; images in the air &quot; a sense of <mask> as if someone blew on your fingertip .
there are also <mask> the nerve endings in fingers , which is also a promising area .
- have you <mask> the mind ?
to <mask> should be feeling when it sees something ?
- this <mask> &apos;t tried this yet .
it conceals one challenge that will not be solved so quickly - how to <mask> he is walking along an open , almost limitless space ; we are working on the concept of treadmills ( not at all like in clubs ) , moving platforms , and giant balloons .
so far deceiving the mind has had limited success , there &apos;s work <mask> years to come .
that &apos;s what makes working on virtual reality so attractive to <mask> are in their very beginnings .
judgement calls instead <mask> - rosbalt.ru
rosbalt continues the project st. petersburg avant ##at##-##at## garde , dedicated to residents who are ahead , in the avant ##at##-##at## <mask> .
this top list already includes outstanding figures of the art scene of st. <mask> city , often recognized in europe , bypassing fame in russia .
the new player in rosbalt - the <mask> .
the whole city knows kirill miller , a bearded man dressed all in red , who can be seen by the russian museum , or by the summer garden , or at fashionable parties <mask> .
kirill miller &apos;s <mask> in crowds of people , no matter where they are exhibited .
kirill miller is one of the purely st. petersburg social and philosophical <mask> of new mythology .
kirill miller is an outstanding man of the <mask> 80 &apos;s early 90 &apos;s .
moreover , he is a city man , who makes people smile on the street and lifts <mask> &apos;s spirit .
recently he took up the street organ and became st. <mask> and image .
- kirill , why do you walk <mask> for example ?
- i chose the <mask> a fashion designer engaged in look and image .
in this <mask> ##at##-##at## maker and society .
although in society , everything that is not grey causes aggression and agitation of the bad <mask> .
but <mask> are aimed at starting conversation .
the whole <mask> provocative actions is an invitation to discussion .
- when did you realise that you must be <mask> ?
- at an exhibition in the nevsky house of culture , where my work <mask> .
it became <mask> my path .
then , the wave of older <mask> was gone , while new , free artists like me were not understood .
i became friends with the artists of the new wave , with post ##at##-##at## gaza ##at##-##at## nevsky style artists ( &quot; post ##at##-##at## gazonevschina &quot; ) , which <mask> .
i &apos;m drawn to theatre , clothing , music , all genres <mask> for literature .
- and all this has been united in your art ##at##-##at## clinic ... - it was important <mask> st. petersburg , where all the best creative forces should come together .
in 1995 , i occupied the territory on pushkinskaya ##at##-##at## 10 , and while the <mask> was a musical and creative club , a bohemian club , the house of the st. petersburg bohemia .
many were born there : nomy , tequila jazz <mask> ear project .
shnur and his friends lip sang easy songs , wearing tight leotards , and the now trendy composer igor vdovin was <mask> .
when the group began to play live , it became <mask> .
trakhtenberg was the presenter of many programs before hali <mask> .
we gave them trakhtenberg , and a great career was <mask> from us .

that is <mask> for .
i <mask> when culture meant something .
in 2000 <mask> in the press , for the people of our city prize .
i was nominated artist of the year , my <mask> to an end .
in the new times , it is uncomfortable to work by old rules . <mask> honesty and culture of the last century .
in our time , it is easy to become popular , but culture and popularity are different . you can be popular , but not <mask> cultural .
- your work is marked by <mask> .
- many of my works are hits , with clearly reflected <mask> and acuity .
i will have <mask> . &quot;
clowns <mask> .
i was social before , now it is <mask> be like that .
but everything is blurred in clowns <mask> is removed .
i <mask> ideas .
for example , <mask> .
nowadays , people are judged by <mask> not their inner qualities .
who knows , maybe you cannot shake his hand , and <mask> his face .
and <mask> help of changing clothes .
- recently we saw <mask> man . - a cultural city should have such a character .
who fits the role better <mask> i ?
- maybe <mask> art can also be beautiful ?
- nowadays , commercial art should <mask> sweet .
there is a <mask> cultures .
people used to <mask> in flocks , bohemians liked one thing , the simple people , something else .
now , everybody is divided <mask> &apos;s hard to be liked by everyone .
i am not <mask> to please all .
now you have to <mask> will please .
now , each cult hero has <mask> .
- <mask> stas mikhailov !
- the <mask> , the sexual ##at##-##at## social sphere is at work there .
but 300 people will come for culture , not 10,000 . in the end , there &apos;s less management , money , <mask> .
i have fans ; the <mask> thing is not to betray them , not to spoil what i have earned .
in my youth <mask> hanging on the same wall with falk and larionov .
i started with paintings , which <mask> end with .
concepts are often <mask> days .
people say : <mask> , consumer culture .
there is no culture in consumerism , it &apos;s &quot; <mask> another opera . &quot;
i am a man of yesterday &apos;s culture . i grew up on examples of <mask> painting .
this is the <mask> for .
- kirill , what is st. <mask> missing ?
- good cultural <mask> .
there <mask> thing : an official for culture .
but <mask> engaged in culture .
under the right rulers everything was different . kings may not have understood culture very well , but they <mask> they needed to stick with the right experts .
there are good consultants <mask> now .
here in st. petersburg , there are people who could <mask> pushed to the side , because more advanced experts are needed , who will correctly evaluate these experts and give way to them .
judgement calls <mask> now .
even erart , but they &apos;re different because they say honestly that we don &apos;t accept all modern art . there are <mask> for themselves .
- <mask> does st. petersburg mean to you ?
- st. petersburg is not a cultural capital , moscow has much <mask> .
it <mask> to grow on our rocks .
we need cultural bedrock , but we now have <mask> is wrong .
in europe , there are many curious people , who go to art <mask> concerts .
here , this layer is <mask> .
we need to make art fashionable , as it <mask> last century .

caravans of cosmic ships <mask> humans on board leave in search of a replacement planet .
to save humanity , the question is how to propagate our race in conditions of weightlessness or on that replacement <mask> ?
i think the choice is <mask> .
there are only two actual planets that can be <mask> .
&quot; venus and mars , &quot; says senior researcher of the p.k. shternberg state astronomy institute ( gaish ) vladimir <mask> .
but while conditions on mars are <mask> ##at##-##at## degree temperatures .
life is possible only <mask> venus ... in space .
the question of reproduction in <mask> with flora .

then , insects <mask> small fruit flies .
in 1979 , quail eggs were sent to space , <mask> an embryo develops in weightlessness .
we <mask> chick .
but then the problem <mask> .
&quot; the problem is related to the fact that this chick needs to find support , needs to get on its feet and start moving , &quot; explains head of the laboratory of the institute of medical and biological problems <mask> ran vladimir sychev .
having found no support , chicks were tumbling <mask> in disorder .
after 10 hours <mask> instincts .
chicks did not react to <mask> .
and the problem was that they simply died <mask> four days .
&quot; we bred chicks twice there , and then stopped , because it is impossible to work with them there , &quot; says vladimir sychev , confirming <mask> in space .
the last biological &quot; <mask> .
in spring 2013 , experiments <mask> continue .
however , only same ##at##-##at## sex beings will be <mask> bio ##at##-##at## satellite .

&quot; this was on bio ##at##-##at## satellites , but again , it was a <mask> .

but it &apos;s <mask> .
it &apos;s not <mask> task .
animals simply cannot follow their <mask> .

such experiments are <mask> for ethical reasons .
but women <mask> flying to space for 50 years .
the biggest risk was for <mask> .
the most valuable thing <mask> is the female body .
our <mask> left and nobody on earth could tell whether she would be ok after flying to space .
whether <mask> this flight .
&quot; nobody answered this question , <mask> industry veteran , vakhtang vachnadze .
in june 1964 , only a year after flying to space , the first woman <mask> a daughter .
the child <mask> andrian nikolaev , was also a cosmonaut .
in 1988 , the second woman <mask> and even worked in open space , gave birth to a son .
however , <mask> .
we have few , very few cosmonauts , who were ok and had healthy children <mask> flights .
&quot; what &apos;s more , it is dangerous even for orbital flights , &quot; adds pilot and cosmonaut , hero of the ussr , hero of <mask> poliakov .
and yet , humanity needs to seek out some new avenues <mask> creation of artificial gravity .

here , cosmonauts practice skills of working in open <mask> conditions .
water <mask> .
if for adults water is a foreign medium , although <mask> native element .
small amphibians seem to confirm <mask> land from the ocean .
there is a connection with the fact that an infant spends about 9 months in amniotic fluid in <mask> easier to get used to water after that .
in principle , it is logical , because only two weeks pass from birth <mask> the first bathing .
&quot; this is very little time to <mask> something , &quot; says infant swimming instructor marina aksenova .
in <mask> newborn weightlessness is more natural , a woman needs gravity , earth &apos;s pull .

well , let &apos;s assume that childbirth stimulators <mask> work out .
maybe she will push out the <mask> room .

nku <mask> of politicians .
the czech republic has sound control bodies and a good standard <mask> comes to public contracts , but it lags behind in their application .
this was said by miloslav kala , vice <mask> office ( nku ) in an interview for aktualne.cz.
&quot; the law will never be perfect , but its application should be just - this is what we are missing , <mask> the current situation .
similar conclusions are also reached by the joint audit from the czech and german <mask> .
as an example of improper practice , they cite petr necas &apos;s <mask> so ##at##-##at## called &quot; svarc system . &quot;
the prime minister <mask> checks - so is it forbidden or allowed ?
&quot; the law must be set out one way or the other and if it prohibits something , then even the government &apos;s head cannot prevent the <mask> kala .
at the audit committee &apos;s session in the house of deputies , you spoke about a joint project between the czech republic and germany , within which legislation relating to public contracts in <mask> was compared .
what exactly <mask> about ?
this is about parallel <mask> two years ago .
simply put , this is about how european legislation governs the handling of public contracts , <mask> itself .
we brought <mask> together , and although the audit is not yet complete , some very interesting differences have become apparent - in general terms , our legislation might be even &quot; more concise and complete , &quot; however the actual practice is in certain aspects better in germany .
this confirms that creating more and more concise rules is not enough , and that attention must be paid to the actual <mask> laws .
what does this project actually help you with , and <mask> outcome will bring ?
this kind of joint audit could contribute to curtailing these efforts to specify our law , to reduce and perfect boundaries , when it does not have such a <mask> .
economy means acquiring the required thing at a reasonable ( which does not always mean the lowest ) price , so that profiteering <mask> avoided .
however , just because we have reduced the <mask> procured .
the system might <mask> those , who wish to look for loopholes in it , will be able to take advantage far more easily than if the limits had remained higher .
these are domestic problems <mask> public contracts .
how does the audit system work in <mask> ?
is there <mask> or is it organised differently ?
as far as the office is concerned , the bundesrechnungshof functions like our nku , and it is organised like ours , it also has a committee although it is appointed slightly differently , but basically both <mask> operate similarly .
powers are also similar to a degree , though of course germany <mask> these courts of auditors are also at the member state levels - in this respect their system slightly differs from our own .
the brh can only audit federal money , <mask> state funds .
public funds , which , for us , are administered by regional and municipal authorities <mask> courts of auditors there .
when it comes to their legislation , is it more <mask> ?
overall , i would not like to make a comparison without any specific data , nevertheless in certain respects germany serves as an example , but it certainly cannot be said that it is better <mask> aspect .
is this because , perhaps , they <mask> better enforcement ?
that is certainly not true , <mask> make such comparisons .
it should be said that even in a <mask> range of problems .
if that were not the case , <mask> our office , would they ?
coming back to domestic legislation , what did the amendment to <mask> already ?
the period since the amendment came into force has <mask> audit work yet .
since we carry out our audits ex <mask> a certain delay has to be taken into account .
as yet , we have only <mask> &quot; system , with which we have processed almost 14 thousand public contracts , and these have been analysed - that is where changes will clearly be seen , because of the changed limits , the adjusted conditions governing certain types of selection processes , and so on .
so do you see the adoption of this legislation as a benefit , or rather <mask> ?
i believe this legislation is a step in the <mask> be confirmed .
a problem , which may arise here , is that the law becomes &quot; too constrained &quot; <mask> not be enforceable .
under the previous rules , parties being audited were already <mask> of regional operational programmes , the regional office ) to the fact that every infringement of public contracts law means a breach of budgetary discipline .
is it worth constraining the law in this way , in <mask> case ?
i do <mask> is the way .
the system should prevent those who want to attack and abuse it , but not penalise those , who <mask> affect the final decision .
this kind of system will only increase <mask> bureaucracy .
so how can we get out <mask> ?
let &apos;s see <mask> us .
the prime minister recently said the ods will not be burdening businessmen with audits of <mask> svarc system &quot; - what does this mean ?
is the svarc system prohibited or <mask> ?
the law must be set out one way or the other , <mask> work of its department , which is duty ##at##-##at## bound to monitor and enforce .
he <mask> but he cannot say we should pretend it is not there .
the <mask> the right way to ensure public tenders are protected .
on the other <mask> tragedy , when a bidder with the best offer is excluded on a technicality .
the law will never be perfect , but its application should be just - this is what we <mask> opinion .

simon ornest : at <mask> fusion of positive energy
what is <mask> might come in less than a month ?
it is just another <mask> which we like to latch on to .
together with the tap tap band , we tend to joke about it , saying that we might be the only band on earth that could <mask> positive energy to hold off or avert the end of the world completely .
in december <mask> unique series of three concerts against the end of the world .
can you give <mask> ?
this is a nationwide fund ##at##-##at## raising event , which we have been planning <mask> years .
we decided to make use of the marketing potential of the end of the mayan calendar <mask> a.m.
on <mask> , 3 concerts will take place in parallel in prague , brno , and ostrava .
they will end at around the time when kiribati island in the pacific , which is 12 hours ahead of us , reaches the end of the mayan <mask> .
who came up with this <mask> ?
initially it was probably my idea , later we worked all the details out <mask> honza augusta .
apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to stop the end of the world , we also want to allow ourselves and the public to spare some thoughts for the state of our planet , when we , one day , <mask> over to our children .
on the occasion of the end of the mayan calendar , we have also prepared a range of unique items , shoes <mask> www.e ##at##-##at## tap.cz to support our cause .
the tap tap band , together with other artists <mask> world is cancelled . &quot;
it is already well received on youtube , will it figure at the fund <mask> ?
of course , for the grand finale , as long <mask> end beforehand .
it will be sung by all the <mask> time .
the anthem will also be featured in a unique <mask> .
the words were written and the role of jesus in <mask> x also sings in it ...
how did you end <mask> them ?
we collaborate also with <mask> personalities of the czech cultural scene , due to organising a lot of fund ##at##-##at## raising events and concerts ...
we try to really <mask> projects .
it turns out that most of them are interested and <mask> .
what will the <mask> concert against the end of the world go to ?
equipping the wheelchair <mask> the citizens association tap from the jedlicka institute for the disabled .
tutors come in regularly to spend time with the jedlicka <mask> they enjoy and interest them .
the students themselves do not have the funds to afford tutors , so we try to <mask> this for them in this way .
within the construction project at the jedlicka institute , a separate building is <mask> can move into with this project .
every <mask> bands and artists .
how do <mask> ?
we have tried to compile a programme , which speaks <mask> .
for example , in prague , chinaski , support lesbiens , illustratosphere with dan barta , the tap tap , marian bango and <mask> appear .
further <mask> can be found at www.kpks.cz.
are you planning any more &quot; bombastic events &quot; in <mask> ?
in may , we will be making our first appearance in the prague spring , so we will definitely be preparing a good line ##at##-##at## up <mask> interesting guests .
next year , <mask> we will be in the usa - would like to build in appearances in washington and chicago .
your international plans are not modest ; you <mask> , brussels , london , and moscow .
the tap <mask> a band composed of handicapped people .
how do you cope with these journeys in terms of logistics and <mask> ?
it is not as scary as it might seem <mask> .
we have five members in electric wheelchairs , which must be transported in the luggage area ; we must also , of course <mask> instrument cases ...
nevertheless , we have so far managed it without any problems , csa and british airways were well prepared for us , so much <mask> , i was quite surprised .
even in <mask> , which we have just returned from , it all went smoothly .
thanks to these international trips , you <mask> to compare specific accessibility issues , public attitudes to disability and so on .
what have <mask> your experiences so far ?
after madrid , luxembourg , london and other places , where everything functions <mask> we have just witnessed that in the east everything is still in its beginnings .
compared to prague , moscow is rather inaccessible ; it still remains unusual there for a person in an electric wheelchair to be travelling around the <mask> own .
obvious things , such as giving wheelchairs priority in lifts , are <mask> there .
fortunately , citizens associations <mask> to the problems faced by people with disabilities .
and on the other hand , where do we still lag behind more advanced <mask> ?
there are <mask> on ...
it <mask> mention that improvements to the current situation always depend on the efforts of the people who are affected .
in london and madrid it is completely <mask> use the toilets , go to the museum , or wherever ...
it is less common there for large groups of <mask> social life , in this respect with the tap tap we are a step ahead !
public respect or accessibility is one thing , but it is only when we can become famous athletes , artists <mask> , politicians , or lawyers that things will really begin to change .
so far there are only exceptional cases , <mask> who are strong ##at##-##at## willed .
the tap tap band <mask> back a few years , what prompted you in 1998 to form it ?
i began my job as a <mask> interested in doing something .
since i am a musician myself - among others i play the saxophone - i started a music club <mask> a colleague .
with time , as our moderator ladya angelovic says , it has <mask> of our control ( laugh ) .
your popularity has only come about in the last few years , or am <mask> ?
it is true that we have been helped by creating ties to famous <mask> the band .
we realised that work , which goes on unseen can be like it <mask> existed .
thanks to funds from the european <mask> , equipment and so on .
was it your <mask> to take the tap tap to such heights ?
from the outset <mask> to do things a little differently .
show business is filled with things , where one imitates the <mask> .
it is logical in its own way ; all new things are taken in <mask> and take a long time .
things , which are unique , are <mask> dare to claim that tap tap is one of those things .
a person &apos;s first impression on seeing you is , of course , pity - it is a natural <mask> ...
but that pity is simply wasted , <mask> not abandoned and suffering beings , who need to be pitied .
they are people , who can fully live life and blossom , assuming , of <mask> right environment for it .
i say that when a person with a handicap succeeds in something , it is not just progress for <mask> but for society as a whole .
has your success also been helped by your firm hand as a leader , as many <mask> ?
if we want to achieve top class <mask> in many things and require a certain level of discipline .
i think <mask> .
some people come to us with a romantic idea and their head in the clouds , and when they find out they have to go <mask> enthusiasm quickly disappears .
that is how it works everywhere , with every group that wants to work and wants to achieve <mask> .
the tap tap band currently <mask> .
how many of those <mask> at the beginning in 1998 ?
only <mask> .
we are <mask> this is unavoidable .
those who have <mask> and the drive will always find our door open .
the event takes <mask> is expected , on thursday 20.12.2012 from 9pm .
the venues will be praha incheba , brno fleda , and ostrava plynojem with performances from 12 bands and other musicians <mask> czech republic .
all three cities will be joined by a televised link ##at##-##at## up at the evening &apos;s close for a united rendition of the tap tap &apos;s anthem &quot; the end <mask> &quot;
the concert &apos;s goal is to raise funds to equip the studeo multi ##at##-##at## functional wheel ##at##-##at## chair accessible learning centre at the jedlicka institute in prague in the sum <mask> crowns .

poland and the <mask> .
last week the council of ministers of the european space agency admitted poland as the twentieth <mask> 12th of november 2008 ) .
poland began close cooperation with the esa in 1994 , and in the following years it has participated in a series <mask> .
of course , poland &apos;s path to the <mask> much earlier .
polish boffins <mask> before the second world war , but were not always met with understanding .
i look back , for instance , to the lecture of a sternfeld in warsaw &apos;s astronomy observatory , who , on the 6th of december <mask> into space .
the thoughts of the young engineer ( born 1905 ) left his audience cold , and years <mask> an interest in his work .
in 1934 , for his work entry into space , sternfeld received the robert esnault ##at##-##at## pelterie and <mask> .
the above mentioned dr. jan gadomski ( 1899 - 1966 ) later became a strong promoter of astronomy and <mask> .
he published hundreds of articles in polish journals , and <mask> a series of books on these scientific subjects .
gadomski became a world ##at##-##at## known promoter of astronautics and <mask> side of the moon was named after him .
in 1925 , poland had <mask> built a handcar which was supposed to be fitted with a rocket engine .
unfortunately , <mask> &apos;s details , are unknown .
it is not <mask> , whether the rocket was intended to start the handcar or to slow it down .
information about this rail track is <mask> articles of the time .
in 1933 the polish artillery started their engagement in flying <mask> .
the research was undertaken by the <mask> division in collaboration with prof. mieczyslaw wolfke and prof. gustaw mokrzycki .
from the documents , it is clear <mask> .
of course , the advance of the <mask> .
in 1937 , the concept of a photoelectric homing rocket designed by engineer rohozinski appeared in the trade press , and in the following year <mask> authored by leliwy ##at##-##at## krywoblocki .
both projects were destined for <mask> of rocket engines .
immediately prior to the war , all projects for military use of rocket technologies were overseen by the provisional scientific advisory board ( tymczasowy komitet doradczo <mask> that coordinated all the work .
the board was appointed in 1937 , but after two years of activity their operations were <mask> of the war .
further work devoted to <mask> the polish press after the war thanks to the polish astronautics company ( polskie towarzystwo astronautyczne ) .
the first reference to the <mask> november issue of the magazine problems in 1954 , in which four in ##at##-##at## depth articles are on the subject of astronautics .
in one of these , by prof. subotowicz , the establishment of a company is proposed , which would dedicate <mask> .
at the time , there were already projects underway for artificial satellites and it <mask> research was an emerging sector .
from the <mask> international astronautics federation ( est . 1951 ) and by autumn the pta was already a full member .
in the following year , <mask> the international astronautics federation .
he served in this capacity <mask> .
from 1956 , the pta played a significant role in the successful development of meteorological <mask> the first polish rocket to enable scientific research .
the first rm ##at##-##at## 1 model was completed in 1957 and the first <mask> the 10th of october 1958 .
the rocket , <mask> cm in length and weighed a little under 5 kg .
later , the improved rm ##at##-##at## 1a version was constructed and in the summer <mask> .
the rocket was 1.4 metres in length <mask> 11.5 kg .
a further development model was designed for real scientific work - the rm ##at##-##at## 34 rocket was to reach 14.5 <mask> monitoring high altitude winds .
of course , in 1962 <mask> .
the successor to the <mask> to 1965 .
the rocket was designed as a two ##at##-##at## stage rocket , with a total length of 510 cm and a <mask> of 32.5 kg .
three <mask> ##at##-##at## 1a , -1b , and -1c ) , which differed in the room available for scientific apparatus .
in the meteor ##at##-##at## 1a rocket , a space of 0.4 litres was available , meteor ##at##-##at## 1b had 0.34 litres , and meteor <mask> .
the maximum altitude for <mask> 37km .
between 1965 and 1968 <mask> meteor ##at##-##at## 2 was underway in the aeronautics institute , with its first launch tests in october 1970 .
the meteor <mask> lifting a useful load of 10 kg to a height of around 60km .
subsequently built <mask> meteor ##at##-##at## 2h and meteor ##at##-##at## 3 .
poland &apos;s admission to cospar ( committee for space research ) in 1960 should be mentioned , as well as the appointment of <mask> .
poland also <mask> soviet artificial satellites , and in 1978 , the polish pilot miroslaw hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after vladimir remkov .
abolishing the legislation <mask> works is not the solution .
last week the constitutional court abolished the law on public <mask> .
the resolution <mask> public debate .
it will certainly be interesting to look <mask> a broader perspective .
liberally oriented financial systems in the eu , just <mask> on the principle of an unregulated economic competition .
its effect means <mask> are in a state of permanent conflict among themselves .
the cause is the principle of free trade and free , completely unregulated movement of private capital together with uncontrolled financial <mask> .
due to significant labour <mask> differences ( salaries ) there is pressure on prices .
on this basis , it <mask> be understood that when a supplier tries to compete in a commercial tender by importing cheap goods , &quot; the rug is pulled &quot; from under the competition &apos;s prices to capture a greater market share and , in this way , increase its own profits .
on a wider scale , this means most businesses must move production abroad <mask> high unemployment in countries where labour costs are high compared to other economies .
since private capital is not bound by social <mask> not by the unemployment it causes , the social costs born by the state must necessarily increase .
the whole situation is bolstered by the businessman <mask> harm caused in the pursuit of profit .
the situation is <mask> data .
the ruthless private capital <mask> competition , aiming to artificially lower the social standard of its own citizens in order to attract foreign investment .
in other words , governments stake their own citizens because of private capital while disregarding the <mask> in social standards .
this occurs chiefly in amendments to <mask> law .
the aim is to economically force the domestic population to accept prices dictated by private capital , especially in terms of <mask> .
on <mask> , in case of long ##at##-##at## term unemployment , on the other , restricted employee rights in the workplace .
this yields growing poverty <mask> .
in germany there are already <mask> who are not able to feed themselves on their own wages .
the <mask> in the millions .
in the name of improving the competitiveness of the german economy , it commonly occurs that properly employed people receive such a salary that the state <mask> the minimum wage .
just such a scandal was <mask> staff in the bundestag .
the austerity measures for all the southern eu states will undoubtedly lead to the same situation , where people are pressured by a catastrophic drop in living standards to emigrate as it was in the 19th century , or to eke out an existence on starvation wages on the edge of society , <mask> investment .
at <mask> come from ?
if it is to come from other eu states , then poverty is being shifted from one country to another , or it will not come at all <mask> , turkish , moroccan , egyptian , and african labour is still at a fraction of european wages .
this <mask> latin america .
liberal theory and the media incessantly claim that the state may not <mask> economy leads to economic ruin .
private capital cruelly insists on the viewpoint that the state must not <mask> .
thereupon , we should ask ourselves whether private <mask> selfish ends .
here , the <mask> be yes .
the proof is the existence of the almost omnipotent , and in all states , <mask> lobby .
the result is a desperate situation manifesting itself through corruption , through mutual benefits and legislation , where almost everything is criminal , but <mask> .
in germany the situation is such that state ministries , through lack of financial resources , contract out the drafting of <mask> , who are basically connected with industry .
these laws <mask> bundestag .
real power does not come from the people as the western <mask> constitutions claim , but from strong financial organisations that look after their own interests .
it is clear that liberally ##at##-##at## orientated democracies will now quickly reach a situation , as is described by appian in his work on the roman republic crisis in the time of cesar <mask> : &quot; the state was already long in complete degeneration and its offices taken by force .
with bribery , illegal acquisition of benefits , and <mask> or swords .
bribery and corruption were rife and unhindered , and the people would vote for a result which had been bought &quot; ... &quot; people with principles did not run for office , so on one occasion the whole debacle meant the <mask> appian had pompei in mind , but it was cesar who changed democracy for autocracy permanently .
the conclusion , just as in antiquity , the current society is built on unscrupulous tendencies for <mask> .
private capital in its present state is not able to understand the interests <mask> whole .
the outcome is now , as it was <mask> , an unprecedented decadence of the elite with no attempts whatsoever on deeper reaching reforms .
the causality of the rise of the fascist and communist regimes should therefore be sought in the misguided liberalisation <mask> centuries .
the current state of affairs , when we consider the demise of those systems in <mask> can expect its next cycle .
the particularly catastrophic reality is that the current elite is completely ignoring the potential lost of hundreds of thousands of lives , humanitarian and social disasters , which we are already witnessing , as well as crimes <mask> as we are familiar with from ancient and modern history .
the abolition of the law on public works is not the answer , at least not in <mask> .
under the pressure of economic competition , internationally <mask> , the government of the czech republic will be forced to pursue ways of lowering the population &apos;s living standards .
this pattern is thus <mask> .
to address this , there are targeted political and <mask> over society in favour of the state .
israel : <mask> lab .
&quot; nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could , &quot; from sting <mask> , where one of the main verses from the refrain is &quot; lest we forget how fragile we are . &quot;
&quot; if my sons did not want war , there would be none , &quot; said the dying gutle schnapper , wife of <mask> amschel rothschild in 1849 .
the latest wave of violence between israel and the gaza strip , as always , has sparked a lot of <mask> .
some stand by israel , arguing it has the right to self ##at##-##at## defence , and palestinians are portrayed as terrorists , while <mask> that genocide is being committed against palestinian arabs , and that israel is a terrorist state .
i do not want to dwell , in these repeated periodic waves of killing , on who is the transgressor and who is the victim , after all , today &apos;s inhabitants of israel , including the self ##at##-##at## governing territories , were born into the current <mask> the start of the violence .
i would like to offer the readers a peek behind the scenes , a look at whom , most of all , this 95 ##at##-##at## year long <mask> on this small piece of land in the middle east .
some of my thoughts are supported by available historical facts , while others are derived from my own understanding of who , that is , which group of people is the main source of events in <mask> .
human history is in the first instance about the <mask> .
in every era we can find an alexander the <mask> or a napoleon .
what is not quite so apparent is whether these were the people , who had chosen their path independently , or whether behind their throne stood <mask> directed their actions towards a pre ##at##-##at## calculated goal .
we must accept that we live in a time when the world &apos;s wealth is concentrated into the hands of a few individuals , and that <mask> of wealth and the power it exudes could not happen in one generation &apos;s lifespan .
among these astronomically rich families , one stands <mask> unsure , but i would not rule it out ) - the rothschilds .
not much <mask> about them .
the first news agency ( reuters ) they bought in the 90 &apos;s of the 19th century , in order to prevent their name being connected with <mask> always meant securing power , increasing wealth , or both .
they hold majority stakes in almost every central bank in the world , and against the countries , where they do not hold a stake , they are either waging or preparing for war ( before the assault on afghanistan it was 7 countries , after iraq it was 5 , after the overthrow of kaddafi 4 remained <mask> bank to the russian government ) .
whoever attempted to <mask> this family died .
abraham lincoln refused to renew the status of the central bank to the rothschild bank of america , and during the civil war he began to <mask> own ( that is state ##at##-##at## issued ) money and was assassinated in 1865 at the theatre .
jfk began issuing his own money and <mask> after he had intended to sue the fed for causing the great depression of 1929 .
their thirst for global power led in the years of 1859 - 1871 to the formulation of a three ##at##-##at## world ##at##-##at## war plan by the <mask> of the 33rd degree , albert pike .
the first war was to remove the large monarchic state bodies in europe , the second was to remove colonial rule , especially from great britain , and the third will reduce the world &apos;s population down to 0.5 - 1 billion people ( this number of slaves will suffice for their comfort and luxury , and will not <mask> , the creation of one universal faith ( ecumenism is just an appetiser for this solution ) , and finally the seizing of absolute power .
the method , which the group of wealthy families with <mask> ( order ab chao - order from chaos ) .
these <mask> false , however , and always lead to a worse situation ( vide establishment of the fed , so that the crisis of 1907 would not be repeated ) .
thus , having succeeded in assassinating ferdinand , the habsburg heir to the austro ##at##-##at## hungarian throne , in sarajevo <mask> destroyed tsarist russia with the bolshevik revolution .
the first world war ended abruptly , militarily and economically unsubstantiated , with german capitulation ( the war was no <mask> tsarist russia ) and the central european powers of austria ##at##-##at## hungary were subsequently dismantled .
to facilitate the inception of the second world war , they allowed bankers and politicians to create a latent conflict situation by saddling germany with <mask> only to introduce a sufficiently convincing culprit and a leader with a simple solution , while also creating a multi ##at##-##at## racial czechoslovakia with a strong german minority to play , and indeed did , the role of a fifth colony , once the war had been ignited .
at the end of the 19th century , the rothschilds instigated the establishment of the zionist movement <mask> of historic judea , jerusalem , to make its capital ( the return to zion ) .
the aforementioned balfour declaration formed the basis for the mass immigration of jews to palestine , where <mask> with the local arab population .
terrorist attacks occurred on <mask> sides .
world war ii broke out , and <mask> is difficult to determine , nevertheless the suffering of european jews in the concentration camps created the foundation to the world &apos;s acceptance of the jewish state .
israel was officially formed in 1948 , and just as the war reparations for world war ii were layed <mask> , the announcement of the state of israel became the third war &apos;s hotbed .
provided the international bankers succeed , the jewish nation , as with the second , will be the victims on the front line , now <mask> , muslim - population of the middle east .
israel is like a huge laboratory , a source of discord and chaos not only within the country , but on an international level ( just look <mask> of israel ) .
who <mask> israel conflict , where injustice breeds injustice in an endless cycle of violence , while everything began from the greed of a few and their lust for global power ?
here , we must differentiate between israel &apos;s general <mask> , the international bankers introduce their own selection of candidates for people to vote for .
israel &apos;s current prime minister , netanyahu &apos; the hawk &apos; , is a typical example of a fascist <mask> with iran , which would , due to its membership in the shanghai cooperation organisation ( china , india , russia , pakistan , ... ) lead to a greater threat of global conflict , and through its control of the hormuz strait , where 20 % of the world &apos;s oil must sail ( the channel is only 2 miles wide ) , to the destruction of the world &apos;s economy .
in what light <mask> we need is a major crisis and the nations will accept the new world order . &quot;
the <mask> one of master and slave .
a world where the rest of the human population serve the <mask> of financial aristocrats .
a world , where each new ##at##-##at## born is implanted with a chip , which makes their existence completely <mask> .
&quot; he also forced everyone , small and great , rich and poor , free and slave , to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead , so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark , which <mask> the number of his name .
if anyone <mask> number of the beast ,
for it is man &apos;s number . his number is six <mask> sixty six . &quot;
argo : when things <mask> .
in november 1979 , a mob of islamic student <mask> the american embassy in tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage .
they were to be released in exchange for the overthrown shah mohammad reza pahlavi , who fled after the revolution to the usa , which had actually supported <mask> several decades .
for the american administration the situation did not offer <mask> could not throw the shah overboard , because this would seriously jeopardise the trust of other allied countries .
the release of the hostages <mask> of the theocratic regime , could not be achieved .
this was a blow to the prestige of the united states , which was later compounded by the fiasco <mask> force .
the <mask> following negotiations mediated by the algerian government .
their ordeal provoked <mask> and anti ##at##-##at## iranian feelings at home .
the debacle in <mask> jimmy carter &apos;s loss with ronald reagan in the 1980 presidential elections .
the film argo , <mask> , recounts one episode in this story , which brought america a small victory .
just before the embassy was <mask> escaped .
after some peripeteia , they ended up in the canadian ambassador &apos;s <mask> .
the cia , in collaboration with the canadian authorities , succeeded in getting them out of iran , helped by an extravagant cover story - they left on canadian passports as members of <mask> ##at##-##at## fi blockbuster .
a <mask> genres
the plan , conceived by &quot; exfiltration &quot; expert , <mask> assistance of hollywood .
for the story <mask> conferences were organised , and the fictitious production company had a real office .
the details of the operation were , for <mask> time , kept secret ; the film draws on the memories of tony mendez .
affleck &apos;s film is <mask> .
on one hand , there is a realistic incisive political <mask> small victories and double ##at##-##at## crossing - another example would be ocean &apos;s eleven .
the mood alternates in the film - on one side , sharp documentary ##at##-##at## style sequences in tehran ( the title sequence shows iconic photos from news of the time , relating to the same events portrayed in the film - there are no big <mask> .
on the other hand , lighter sections from hollywood , laced with irony and a <mask> .
then there are scenes from the cia <mask> agencies - men in suits debating the situation around meeting tables , in office corridors , over the phone ...
ben affleck has <mask> to restart his career in extraordinary style .
the derided actor has become a <mask> acting is no longer the target of ironic comments .
argo is his third big ##at##-##at## screen movie , following his dark crime movie gone baby gone ( 2007 ) and the thriller the <mask> ( 2010 ) .
it is also affleck &apos;s first picture , which does not take place in the director &apos;s <mask> boston .
the atmospheric feel in different locations is one of the <mask> which took his earlier films above hollywood standards .
affleck shows it in argo <mask> .
the best <mask> in the streets , in the reconstruction of real events - the opening sequence of the siege on the embassy is impressively lucid , creating at once feelings of confusion and surprise , which come flooding in , as history suddenly takes a turn .
a similar effect is achieved by affleck and his team in the fictitious scenes ( <mask> tehran bazaar ) .
too much action in <mask> places
the director had to tackle the issue that <mask> .
what <mask> tehran airport by a phone call in america , followed by a chase on the runway seems quite far ##at##-##at## fetched ) .
argo &apos;s weakness is its divergence , which comes from the need to <mask> many events in too many places .
alan arkin and john goodman play their roles as <mask> room , and are not by far the only ones in this film .
affleck &apos;s film loses the dramatic pull a little , it is a film , which can be watched with reasonable interest , its production and <mask> ##at##-##at## style are evocative of thrillers from the 70 &apos;s .
it <mask> not really captivate .
as a reminder of history &apos;s particular ways and <mask> this will do .
rules for blowing up balloons , for <mask> a circus
the www.bankovnipoplatky.com server , which issues a poll every year on the most absurd bank charge , has now <mask> or proposal from the eu . &quot;
&quot; we were <mask> management level of europe &apos;s largest companies , &quot; patrik nacher , the poll &apos;s organiser , told pravo .
among the latest nominated absurdities , for instance , is the recent decision by the european court to <mask> women .
until now , <mask> insurance prices , because they constitute a lower risk for insurers .
&quot; other unbelievable ideas from the eu can be nominated by <mask> the end of the year .
the actual voting will <mask> , &quot; informed nacher .
among the controversial eu regulations , we might include the mandatory addition <mask> substance , or the rules on the size of chicken cages , which significantly raised egg prices this year .
the ban on the use of <mask> of classic light bulbs from sale had previously come under criticism .
first rate bananas are <mask> 14 centimetres
the union &apos;s machine often makes decisions under pressure from this or that commercial or industrial lobbying group , whose demands in brussels are usually defended by state or group of states &apos; interests ( just as the czech republic is <mask> of its banks under threat of being vetoed ) .
the lobby &apos;s interests were , for example , that bananas of the highest quality should measure at least 14 cm in the eu , and were not to display and <mask> . &quot;
the european commission defended itself , <mask> disjointed national standards , which complicated trading .
norms relating to fruit and vegetables have already been softened by the eu despite opposition from certain states , referring to the <mask> by the existing directives .
one possible prize ##at##-##at## winner in the poll may be the last year &apos;s eu regulation according to which inflatable balloons must be sold with a warning that children under 8 years of age may not inflate them without <mask> .
here , the eu pointed to an american <mask> , among other toys , balloons are one of the main causes of child suffocation .
a similar restriction now applies to children under <mask> age using party blowers .
strange <mask> too
fairly <mask> the eu , who holds an official post , may not use the term macedonia due to it being a sensitive topic for greece , and instead the acronym fyrom ( former yugoslav republic of macedonia ) should be used .
the bankovnipoplatky.com server in collaboration with the liberal economist association , laissez faire , also nominated , aside from the aforementioned absurdities , for example the union &apos;s <mask> of food provision stocks held in an eu member state .
the eu stipulated the maximum volumes of food provisions , which may be present within the cr on the day <mask> union .
the czech <mask> the permitted volume of mushroom preserves , which incurred a high penalty .
the poll <mask> because they do not have a coastline , or the suggestion of allocating funding for a request for funding .
these ideas did not come <mask> , but from prague .
&quot; we <mask> sea .
we are asking the european union for a refund , <mask> cssd ) .
his argument was that there had been a good harvest of cereals , and due to the so ##at##-##at## called buy ##at##-##at## out interventions , the state &apos;s warehouses were <mask> .
the czech republic is <mask> of millions of euros .
the european commission finally met the cr halfway by organising a <mask> sea .
funding to subsidise funding requests was offered <mask> specifically this was meant for making requests for funding from brussels .
eu : <mask> is the exception
regulations may well become the target of criticism among <mask> regulation , more effective operation , and development of the entire union deserve recognition , according to a number of experts .
a more important issue , according to experts , is the drawing of eu funds on projects , which have hardly anything in common with strengthening the <mask> member states during a budget meeting .
emotions flare among czechs when <mask> fight in brussels for the right to particular labelling on its traditional products , in which it does not always succeed .
the czechs fought for six years <mask> the labelling of their olomoucke tvaruzky , however the tuzemsky rum , whose tradition reaches back to the 19th century here , had to be renamed tuzemak by the manufacturers .
the appellation of rum can only be given to products distilled from cane sugar <mask> beet .
carlsbad wafers , pohorelicky and trebonsky carp , and zatec hops have been added to the official list of registered products of the eu , alongside <mask> and parma ham .
the eu &apos;s stamp of protection can also <mask> pardubice gingerbread and horicky tubes .
people want me <mask> , says okamura
senator , how does a person <mask> for president ?
this is not <mask> being a senator or president .
if everything in our country worked without problems , then i would <mask> for any post .
i cannot watch any longer the country having been robbed over the past twenty <mask> increasing .
i had no <mask> .
when i <mask> a solution to change things .
since i have already turned forty , and <mask> to influence things but to stand for senator or president .
you have already <mask> that you are taking off for the castle .
are <mask> voted for you in doing this ?
i have been saying the <mask> the castle based on the results in the senate &apos;s elections .
later , i added that if i were elected as senator , i would be standing <mask> .
my goal , though <mask> allow my vision to be realised .
therefore , i need the greatest influence , and the strongest mandate <mask> .
the trouble is not just that as a nation we <mask> things .
the media add to this <mask> , and mistaking freedom of speech with freedom to lie .
for example , i was allegedly bribing reporters , or i was allegedly an advisor of jiri <mask> .
let &apos;s talk about your <mask> .
you set out on your castle siege with a thesis on the material <mask> a retroactive financial disclosure of assets over twenty million .
you <mask> change the law for this .
as president , though , you do not have this <mask> the senate as a whole may propose laws .
how are you <mask> to solve this ?
when i lobbied , as a citizen , for tour guide work to be a free trade , it was <mask> through .
the problem is political squabbling - when someone comes with a good <mask> , it will be deliberately rejected , causing delays for the public .
as an independent non ##at##-##at## party man , i stand a far better chance of gaining <mask> from all parliamentary sides .
the advantage i hold is that without <mask> for our country from any side , and apply it .
do <mask> the right , or the left ?
from the czech viewpoint , it seems they tend <mask> .
for me , it just does not matter if it is a little to the left or <mask> .
the <mask> moving forward .
it is <mask> or right , i just want to bring people together .
i always support any good public solutions , even if they are put forward <mask> .
you get angry when someone calls you a <mask> .
are you not confirming <mask> stated ?
when you make a company business <mask> vision .
you try to come <mask> to it .
some may call it populism , but all the proposals i speak about are already working elsewhere , or <mask> put forward by experts .
but without the support of the parliament you will be left with just <mask> .
you will not <mask> politics with that .
or do you believe that if you walk among the public and talk <mask> will succeed , say , in passing criminal and material responsibility ?
i have <mask> .
i need to convince politicians , reporters , and the <mask> try to get them on my side , so we can put this through .
if i were elected president , it would not be a problem to arrange a live television broadcast , where i ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to pass a law on material and criminal responsibility for politicians , <mask> general .
and , as the case may be , they would need to explain why <mask> .
when there is a strong figure to point out the issues , it <mask> needs some pressure on the political scene .
take for instance the direct election of the president , it was achieved thanks to <mask> pressure .
i will say frankly that i am an <mask> intellectual .
i am looking for allies to share my opinions and <mask> .
i have just started out in politics , and i <mask> majority support for my agenda .
i will try to make things progress , but it if does not work out , in six years i will <mask> the private sector .
it sounds a <mask> the czech republic .
i am no <mask> .
i know that alone i <mask> have asked acquaintances , whether they would run for the senate .
i went to <mask> declined due to his workload .
so i , at least <mask> with light heating oil .
i put myself forward , because people are really discontented , but now <mask> .
sixty percent of people did not go to <mask> who did mostly voted for leaders of the establishment .
in <mask> there are only two independents , including me .
people have voted for a senate that will make it difficult to <mask> changes .
nonetheless , i will fight for my vision , for <mask> election of mayors or regional council presidents .
are you considering having your own <mask> ?
i have not considered it yet , because i have neither the <mask> to verify that every party member has a clean background , nor the money to do it .
i <mask> account holds just 20 thousand .
you <mask> no money ?
you are talking about financial <mask> but what is yours like ?
i estimate my private <mask> 60 million .
in prague , i have land worth around 25 million , an apartment worth ten million , another apartment worth eight million , an artwork collection worth around ten million , an aston <mask> my account .
i have the aston martin , by the way , because it was my dream as a boy - i always liked james bond <mask> car , was gallant with women and also fought against evil and villainy .
you drive an aston <mask> a campaign ?
you say you want to change <mask> but you are not keen on putting your own money into it .
this does not inspire much <mask> .
i do not have 15 million for <mask> .
should i <mask> out a loan ?
i have already <mask> into the campaign .
the fact that i do not have any sponsors is evidence that there is no real interest <mask> .
i have <mask> .
the expenditure on <mask> covered by the pay i will be receiving as a senator .
however , i would not be able to live on it , <mask> could not pay for my son &apos;s english school , which costs 30 thousand a month .
if i were only interested in making money <mask> standing for election .
so you will still <mask> can make a living ?

for example , my deputy is taking over as the ceo of <mask> agency in spring .
people would like me to be a samaritan , who saves <mask> .
but i must also <mask> .
as <mask> you usually make monthly ?
two hundred to 400 thousand <mask> i still do .
and if i became <mask> .

the mvrdv architects prove that true adventures are <mask> of spijkenisse and the recently erected bücherberg ( literally &quot; book mountain &quot; ) - 2 photos
&quot; i think the building is fun , looks futuristic and ultimately provides something interesting <mask> , &quot; said lisette verhaig , a passer ##at##-##at## by at the road ##at##-##at## side .
and <mask> based nearby commented : &quot; it &apos;s definitely a thing of beauty , the building . &quot;
however , <mask> another library in this day and age .
everyone has <mask> , an ipad and ebooks .
no ##at##-##at## one goes into one of <mask> voluntarily nowadays , or am i wrong ?
spijkenisse , a sleepy town outside the gates of rotterdam , which barely <mask> a special record ##at##-##at## holder .
the 80,000 ##at##-##at## resident municipality has the lowest literacy rate in the <mask> netherlands .
in order to counteract this asinine situation , the decision was made a number of years ago <mask> fictitious bridges that feature on the euro notes as pretty , painted reinforced concrete miniatures .
the <mask> of the education offensive was limited .
and so <mask> acknowledged that there was only one way to become master over the statistics : a library had to be built !
winy maas of the rotterdam ##at##-##at## based architectural firm mvrdv , master of audacious bar charts and producer of humorous and often cynical buildings , took the project on with his customary composure , and turned <mask> .
and with the judging panel still looking at him with bewilderment , shrugging their shoulders , the impertinent maas stacked his chosen props by order of size to form a pyramid <mask> - with the words : &quot; dear municipality ! &quot;
so this is my suggestion for the spijkenisse book mountain - for the <mask> !
nine years later , the <mask> been lifted up .
it is part of a revitalisation project , which also includes an underground car park , a supermarket , a post office and a small number of adjacent apartment buildings and terraced houses , with a <mask> 50 dwellings .
at the beginning of november , the bücherberg was awarded second place in the &quot; best library of nl 2012 &quot; <mask> .
in addition , the project is <mask> .
thus , the faceless small ##at##-##at## town retort , that until now had nothing more to offer than a post ##at##-##at## modern pedestrian area and a stunningly ugly town hall , behind whose white facades one would <mask> architecture .
first and foremost , however , spijkenisse now has <mask> .
the long <mask> book
the first impression : the eldorado <mask> beneath a cheese dome .
there is in fact a lift that climbs through <mask> , the true joys of space and literature are revealed when scaling the topography on foot .
the interior space , glazed throughout , is bright and open , the <mask> town square .
the urban <mask> is perfect .
you are already on the lookout for a park <mask> a dog , and boys and girls playing football .
and everywhere there are books , <mask> .
&quot; normally book shelves run along <mask> large , dark space , which is usually unpleasant and impersonal , &quot; says winy maas .
we turned the classical spatial configuration on its <mask> and turned the reading area inside out .
the interior of the bücherberg is cleverly used : in the centre there are offices , an internet library , <mask> the central technical support room .
one particularly special feature are the black book shelves , which simultaneously act as <mask> stairway .
the appearance , feel and scent are <mask> .
even die ##at##-##at## hard architects and construction engineers shake their heads at the <mask> .
&quot; here we wanted to work with recyclable materials , &quot; explained joop <mask> .
and thus one day we stumbled across a suitable waste <mask> used in agriculture , on a frisian farm .
for many years , millimetre ##at##-##at## <mask> fabric has been used in greenhouses and fields in the netherlands as a base layer .
it is inexpensive and <mask> .
the thin <mask> seasons and is then disposed of as bulk waste .
for the library , the fabric was - <mask> .
under heat and pressure , the so ##at##-##at## called landbouw plastic ( klp ) changes colour to a dark , homogeneous and robust material , that smells like a <mask> the smell of trainers .
after 105 steps you have <mask> summit .
at the end of the <mask> café , not only with a fantastic view of the city , but also with dutch croquettes and potted ficus trees .
these provide atmosphere , but most importantly , <mask> range .
donations for the <mask> soul
&quot; you would hardly believe it , but this <mask> area of ecology , &quot; said trouborst .
it is heated <mask> geothermal heat .
although the bücherberg has a glass cover , the sun only shines only briefly <mask> days .
the broad , laminated wood glue beams positioned at right ##at##-##at## angles to the <mask> , provide shade and absorb the majority of the sunlight .
the indoor temperature is <mask> .
the rest is taken care of by <mask> blinds .
stefan spermon <mask> a sceptic of the it sector , has already ventured into the new library .
lisette verhaig has also visited <mask> .
so too has tcm ##at##-##at## teacher , cynthia bogarde , <mask> &quot;
the reason : at the inauguration just a few weeks ago , every citizen <mask> donate a book from his / her personal collection .
this was , for the time being , to fill <mask> items .
the concept <mask> a success .
the shelves are full to <mask> .
&quot; nothing is worse than a half ##at##-##at## empty library , &quot; said architect <mask> maas .
&quot; i <mask> certain bond with this new building .
everyone knows <mask> .
even if <mask> .
as such , mvrdv have succeeded in mastering the master discipline that specialist jargon refers to <mask> .
spijkenisse has written literary <mask> .
however young and <mask> it may be .
this is ultimately a <mask> identity .
szabo <mask> role &quot;
in the vote on the incorporation of palestine <mask> .
according to stephen szabo <mask> us ##at##-##at## european relations , in so doing berlin is walking a thin diplomatic line .
deutsche welle : at the beginning of the week , germany had initially signalled that it would vote against the palestinians &apos; application for observer status within the <mask> nations .
however , berlin subsequently abstained <mask> voting .
stephen <mask> does not support what the israelis have done in gaza .
now , however , <mask> be cautious .
at the same time , however , i do not believe that it supports the <mask> position either .
germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - <mask> of israel .
during the uprising in libya in march 2011 , germany likewise abstained from voting , when it came to <mask> fly zone .
this <mask> by nato .
does <mask> position when it comes to important international affairs ?
yes , it <mask> .
that is because it has just <mask> to speak , managed by the usa , in favour of a german foreign policy .
this situation is aggravated by the fact that the europeans <mask> a coherent and standardised policy .
the germans <mask> two fronts .
it is expected of them that they play a more independent role , yet this is something that they are <mask> to .
i believe that they are still finding their way <mask> .
a foreign policy similar to <mask> britain .
so what specifically does a &quot; normal &quot; foreign <mask> entail , from a german perspective ?
it shows a willingness to adopt positions on international matters <mask> independent of those of the usa or european partners .
i believe that the german foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy , that is , by export and its relations with certain regions such as russia , china or the near <mask> .
germany &apos;s economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other major powers and therefore <mask> must protect its interests .
have <mask> the near east conflict and their voting in the un ?
on the one hand , germany has major revenue markets in the near east , and particularly in the <mask> states .
therefore it <mask> in the arabic countries .
in any case <mask> plays a role .
however , i wouldn &apos;t want to ascribe too much weight to this . this is not an entirely <mask> .
nonetheless , it does play an <mask> role in germany &apos;s considerations .
has germany damaged its relations with the usa , by abstaining to vote on important decisions <mask> palestine ?
i think that in europe , and even in the usa , a great understanding for the <mask> prevails .
therefore i do not think that this was as dramatic a fracture as was the <mask> matters regarding libya .
perhaps it will even earn germany a certain degree of <mask> .
after all , it signals that the country must be taken seriously as an international <mask> .
in europe there are <mask> regarding the palestinian initiative .
the usa , on the other hand , <mask> a veto .
are there differences of opinion <mask> the many european nations ?
due to the american domestic policy , <mask> have always existed .
i think that <mask> a great deal of understanding for the european situation .
however , due to the political situation here , the government is naturally unable to <mask> .
it is my belief that the actual differences in opinion are not so <mask> .
if you look at the relations between obama <mask> minister netanjahu , obama is really not quite so enthused by netanjahu &apos;s policies .
does germany <mask> one hand , and the position of its most important partners in the eu on the other ?
i think that this <mask> difficult for the germans .
it would of course be a little simpler for the germans if there were a coherent and standardised european policy <mask> .
thus they are unable to be part of a wider authority and must <mask> their own position .
this is precisely <mask> with the euro .
i believe that <mask> in urging europe towards a standardised european position .
this is , of <mask> account of its relations with israel .
this has always <mask> a sensitive subject .
yet i do think that germans are clear that they must <mask> a more independent role .
does germany view <mask> assume a leading role ?
or does germany still find leadership roles <mask> ?
germany is still not used to it , the country continues to be uncomfortable <mask> , still finds it difficult to play a more prominent role .
if we look at the euro crisis for example <mask> role , various anti ##at##-##at## german feelings become apparent .
this does not make matters simple <mask> .
this is actually the same old problem : one does not want to be surrounded by hostile <mask> .
from this stance , germany is in <mask> more difficult position than the usa .
it must be receptive to the most diverse of neighbours and <mask> .
the influence of the usa over european politics is continually diminishing , yet the eu is currently not feeling this <mask> , so who is filling the gap ?
the germans will simply have to play a <mask> .
even if they do not like it , even if <mask> unpopular - c &apos;est la vie !

&quot; brand <mask> puma and armani suddenly become chinese
armani is a world ##at##-##at## <mask> lauren likewise .
however , what <mask> polo ?
behind this <mask> whatsoever to do with the original companies .
nonetheless , it is <mask> sue .
and even then it <mask> whether they will have any rights .
&quot; it is becoming increasingly more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in china , &quot; said thomas pattloch , lawyer within the taylor <mask> firm , who specialises in copyright infringement in the far east .
every week a <mask> lands on my desk .
all the copycats require are a few additional letters in order <mask> their brands .
thus gucci simply becomes lu ##at##-##at## gucci , prada ##at##-##at## <mask> in place of prada .
german companies are also &apos; legally &apos; copied <mask> , puma .
pattloch <mask> in peking .
on 14 september 2010 a chinese company copyrighted the brand name zegna df <mask> to the name of fashion retailer ermenegildo zegna .
the fact that the chinese are world champions in copying and infringing on intellectual property is well <mask> .
in <mask> multi ##at##-##at## level department stores that sell counterfeit goods almost exclusively .
pattloch &apos;s cases , however , are slightly different : on behalf of his clients he <mask> elsewhere .
the chinese call this &quot; bang <mask> passenger brand .
the <mask> on &quot; bang dakuan . &quot;
this refers <mask> latch onto rich men .
the chinese authorities are unaware of any <mask> .
&quot; <mask> fight against it , &quot; challenges pattloch .
&quot; the brand is watered down , its uniqueness disappears <mask> damage is enormous . &quot;
the financial <mask> in the case of expensive flagship products .
according to information from market research company clsa , with a volume of 15 billion euros annually , china is the third largest market for luxury items , and the <mask> growing .
however , the deletion of dubious entries in the trademark registry are <mask> cost a pretty penny .
the process can last for up to nine <mask> uncertain outcome .
pattloch reports of instances whereby the court dismisses cases , because after a long period of time , the name to which <mask> become a &quot; market reality . &quot;
if the complainant is unlucky , he may even have to pay the plagiarist money for having infringed on <mask> , said pattloch .
sometimes the law of the jungle prevails <mask> .
famous cases also relate to graphic <mask> .
in <mask> the company that recently acquired german concrete pump manufacturer putzmeister .
even today , the chinese company is therefore permitted to <mask> resembles the mercedes star .
volvo ##at##-##at## purchaser geely originally used a blue and white logo that <mask> and geely was forced to change it .
fashion house lacoste lost a suit in china against copycats from hong kong and singapore <mask> famous crocodile looking in the other direction .
the chinese authorities are <mask> wrongdoing .
the ctmo trademark office in peking does acknowledge that there <mask> due to limited staffing and equipment .
in the past year <mask> situation regarding the work flow . &quot;
thus the stock of unprocessed appeal proceedings was reduced by 22 <mask> .
almost 57,000 <mask> closed , 75 percent more than in the previous year .
nonetheless , there are <mask> the office .
to <mask> this is very expensive
as is so often the case in china , the figures are <mask> .
in the past year , more than 1.4 <mask> applications for trademark protection were submitted to the ctmo , almost one third more than in 2010 .
this is a record and means that china , for the tenth time in succession , is the global leader when it comes to <mask> applications , informed the authority .
the same applies for the inventory of <mask> .
in 2011 , 1.8 billion yuan <mask> received .
put simply , this means that each application costs on <mask> 160 euros .
to appeal against an application costs many times this amount , as can be seen in the <mask> family business , freudenberg .
for more than seven years , the <mask> against a chinese plagiarist .
the germans did in fact manage <mask> motor vehicle parts .
however , the copycat still secured the chinese rights to <mask> brand .
this is something we missed ourselves , as family names cannot be protected in germany , said hanno wentzler , chairman of the board of <mask> specialities in munich .
the ctmo trademark office then also dismissed the munich ##at##-##at## based company &apos;s <mask> .
in the next two instances , freudenberg was proven right , however the opposing party continues to contest the matter to <mask> day .
you have to <mask> attention .
the matter is now pending before the <mask> court .
wentzler is confident that the <mask> brought to a positive conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts .
however , he also says : &quot; the process is extremely <mask> and nerves . &quot;
the internal costs can barely be calculated , the company archive even had to look through century ##at##-##at## old records in order to provide <mask> .
five years ago freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposing party a &quot; high six ##at##-##at## figure <mask> .
&quot; <mask> is worth to us , &quot; says wentzler .
the dangers in the far east <mask> to spilling over , back into europe .
particularly if imitators secure unprotected brand names <mask> .
for example , a chinese manufacturer wanted to <mask> for shoes and leather in germany .
this is a business sector that the group had <mask> vacated , yet nonetheless managed to prevent the registration .
&quot; you have to <mask> .
both <mask> be very careful when conducting business with china .
it is not sufficient to rely on international <mask> is in any way worthy of protection in china as well , &quot; said wentzler .
otherwise <mask> much more expensive than the registration fee .
in actual fact : if freudenberg were to loose at the final hurdle of its <mask> license fees for the use of their own name , explained wentzler .
or alternatively we <mask> out of the market in the respective sector .
world aids <mask> , help
in heidelberg , the imbongi choir is rehearsing <mask> , aids orphans are delighted .
the history of a <mask> .
first of all , the stamping : cowboy boots , basketball shoes , ladies &apos; pumps and men &apos;s loafers <mask> find the beat on the parquet floor , and quickly do just that .
one ##at##-##at## two ##at##-##at## three ##at##-##at## <mask> .
only then do the voices of the singers slowly swell - alto , <mask> surge , beguile and haunt .
and fiete hopf , the 29 ##at##-##at## year <mask> yet wild gestures .
it is monday evening and in the music room of the institute for medical psychology in heidelberg the imbongi choir <mask> new song .
the fifteen singers , aging from 23 to 69 years old , range from <mask> the maintenance man .
&quot; om &apos;obani &quot; is by no means a simple piece , with each voice having a different text , and in an extremely foreign language at that : zulu , which is spoken by eleven million people in <mask> parts of swaziland .
helping others to <mask> themselves
there are around 34 million people infected with hiv around the world , as according to the estimations of unaids , the united <mask> aids .
of these , 23.5 million live in <mask> africa .
in swaziland , there are 245,000 <mask> orphans .
meanwhile , <mask> population are hiv positive .
the voices for africa association has found sponsors in germany for 180 aids orphans <mask> .
70 of these attend <mask> school .
for 15 or 20 euros per month , you can become a <mask> .
this guarantees the child money for school , <mask> and a warm meal each day in the gogo centre .
in zulu , imbongi means <mask> .
in this region , no ##at##-##at## one can speak the bantu language fluently , but they <mask> .
for almost ten years the choir has been practising songs in this foreign , &apos; soft &apos; <mask> , and now and then they bring them back to where they originally came from : the south of africa .
for an 8,733 ##at##-##at## kilometre flight away from heidelberg , in the north west of the swaziland kingdom , lies the village of esitjeni , which relies on the <mask> the german choir .
forty <mask> infected .
around 2,000 people live there , some still in simple mud and straw huts , and the <mask> children .
more than 300 of them no longer have parents , as they <mask> virus .
in esitjeni you get a small foreshadow of the illness from which all of swaziland is suffering : according to unicef , <mask> in the world .
circumcision , which has been proven to reduce the risk of contracting the virus by half <mask> practised by the population .
more than forty percent of people in the swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus <mask> dying in you mid ##at##-##at## thirties is by no means rare .
on a group trip <mask> in early 2005 , the choir visited the village , but first and foremost , the imbongis saw many children on the streets , lacking not only in parental care but in practically everything else as well : food , clothing , education .
without a school leaving certificate , <mask> any opportunities , particularly in a poor country .
initially it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school and enable <mask> year .
however , just one year later , <mask> after the aids orphans in esitjeni at an almost professional level .
facts on sexually transmitted <mask> .
what are the most important sexually transmitted <mask> ?
bacterial <mask> .
common viral stis are hiv , human papilloma viruses , herpes <mask> and hepatitis .
crabs and <mask> stis .
who are the main <mask> ?
syphilis and gonorrhoea occur primarily in <mask> .
the robert koch institute understands that at least four in five of all syphilis cases reported in germany are transmitted by means of <mask> contact between men .
among heterosexual adults , chlamydia infections , trichomoniasis , candidiasis ( fungal ) , gonorrhoea and human papilloma viruses <mask> occurring sexually transmitted diseases .
the <mask> adults in this country is relatively low ; however , around 20 percent of newly contracted cases of hiv are found in this group .
among young people , chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population <mask> .
according to <mask> affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25 .
in this country , human papilloma viruses <mask> found in young people .
how has the number <mask> ?
not all <mask> diseases are notifiable .
according to the robert koch institute , the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1,697 cases in <mask> in 2011 .
the number of newly contracted cases of hiv <mask> .
in 2011 there were around 2,700 <mask> .
this is around <mask> year .
which <mask> a sexually transmitted disease ?
the infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area , <mask> discharge , lower abdominal pain and blisters or warts .
however , often they cause no pain or any other <mask> thus remaining undetected .
how can you <mask> ?
condoms can reduce the risk of contraction , however , they do not offer 100 % <mask> .
this is because occasionally , the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be <mask> bodily contact .
therefore , first and foremost <mask> partners undergo regular examinations .
if diagnosed early , the majority of stis <mask> consequences avoided .
through sponsorships donations and by no means least the funds that the choir raises across the <mask> .
&quot; in total , we have already sent around 200,000 euros to esitjeni , &quot; said annette lennartz <mask> of the association .
in the village itself , zodwa dlamini , a self ##at##-##at## assured and assertive woman , manages <mask> .
she makes sure that the orphans <mask> grandmothers .
the gogos , as <mask> of the village .
some of them have up to 14 orphans living with them , providing them with a roof over their heads and making sure that the children get to their school classes punctually <mask> in their school uniforms .
anyone who doesn &apos;t have anyone left , arrives at the shelter with khanyisile , a single woman <mask> every day .
in addition , &quot; voices for africa &quot; has established a sewing school , <mask> , organised for many in the village to be tested for hiv .
this is nothing to be taken for granted , as is clearly the attitude towards illness throughout the entire country <mask> under wraps is if people are dead .
a king <mask> 14 wives
&quot; aids is an absolute taboo subject , <mask> it is associated with sexuality . &quot;
this is <mask> in which the king officially has 14 wives .
the last <mask> for his excessive lifestyle .
polygamy in place <mask> .
among other factors , the fact that the hiv virus has <mask> .
another factor is the large number of migrant workers who carry the virus across <mask> .
there <mask> corner , said annette lennartz , &quot; but they are hardly used .
the culture <mask> flesh . &quot;
in order to promote the cultural exchange , the imbongi choir travels through southern africa <mask> spirit , confidence and black self ##at##-##at## esteem , which many from the southern tip of the black continent still know from the times of apartheid .
a bus full of white people , who sing songs in a black language - this degree of recognition brings not only morale and joy , but some grim ##at##-##at## faced border soldiers <mask> .
the journey always leads to esitjeni , where <mask> .
even though you can barely find the small village on a map , it is <mask> river .
&quot; go to esitjeni , <mask> light is , &quot; say the people there .
and if you make the 8,733 ##at##-##at## <mask> , you &apos;ll see that the light is there too .

our view <mask> the universe : the most important telescopes
the telescope is thought to have been invented in 1608 by hans lipperhey - even before galileo galilei used the device to observe <mask> later .
since then , the mirrors in optical telescopes <mask> profound .
for a period of 30 <mask> telescope in the palomar observatory near san diego was the largest telescope in the world .
the mirror , <mask> diameter of five metres .
arizona , usa , is home to <mask> binocular telescope .
it enables views of space via two mirrors , each <mask> .
the inner workings of the gran telescopio canarias on the canarian island of la palma are huge - the mirror alone has a diameter <mask> .
the mirror <mask> segmented - to reduce costs .
in spite <mask> it achieves a diameter of around eleven metres .
the disadvantage of this inexpensive construction method <mask> securely clamped at its angle of inclination and its movement is therefore limited .
the hobby eberly telescope in texas also <mask> angle of inclination .
what sets it apart : the high light ##at##-##at## gathering <mask> .
this - in spite of its comparatively low mirror diameter - even matches that of the world <mask> reflector telescopes .
with the help of a radio telescope in arecibo ( puerto <mask> in space .

likewise to be <mask> european extremely large telescope is also being planned .
its main mirror is to <mask> 42 metres and will be made from almost 1,000 mirror elements .
however , <mask> to be expected until 2018 at the earliest .
until 2007 , the two keck telescopes <mask> volcano , mauna kea , were the largest in the world .

in southern <mask> , many people reach ages that can almost be considered biblical .

the journey through the talysh mountains can <mask> .
the minibus rumbles over the winding streets <mask> rivers and simple farmhouses .
everywhere is green and lush - you could be forgiven <mask> black forest .
however , this is <mask> of azerbaijan , and the border with iran is just a few kilometres away .
this is the home of the caucasian <mask> whom not much is known except that they speak perfect persian and azeri and live long lives .
the <mask> is lerik .
the small town is bursting with overpowering architecture <mask> , which doesn &apos;t fit with the picturesque mountain landscape at all .
tourists from europe rarely come here ; the journey from azerbaijan &apos;s capital city , <mask> arduous .
it takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometres <mask> a single track .
the fabulous wealth , for which the country has its oil in the caspian <mask> .
yet pilata fatulayeva ( 48 ) is convinced that lerik <mask> to be a tourist attraction .
&quot; baku became famous in may due to the eurovision song contest , and next year we <mask> world , &quot; said fatulayeva .
she is the director of the museum of longevity , most likely <mask> the world .
here the lives of eight dozen talysh from the area who lived to older than 100 are documented <mask> &amp; white photo .
this here is my grandfather , he <mask> old .
at the age of 136 he <mask> child .
however , the <mask> is shepherd shirali muslimov who is said to have lived to 168 years old .
however no birth certificate exists <mask> this .
and <mask> 122 years of age , muslimov &apos;s claim seems extremely doubtful .
&quot; he was born in 1805 , here in the <mask> fatulayeva .
the man <mask> three times and had 23 children , and is said to have fathered another daughter at the age of 136 .
so did shirali muslimov miscalculate his age by a <mask> ?
but rembrandt scholz , researcher on ageing at the max planck institute in rostock , has also heard of <mask> to impressive ages in central asia .
&quot; a strikingly high number of extremely elderly people can also be <mask> the hunza valley in pakistan , &quot; said scholz , &quot; while there is also an extremely large number of very old men in sardinia . &quot;
due to lacking documentation , however , there <mask> .
melted butter <mask> , every day
however , the fact remains <mask> the region surrounding lerik reach a biblical age with striking regularity .
there are currently 20 individuals <mask> age .
so why do so many <mask> live here in the south ?
the azeri travel guide farid mugimzadeh explains this as being due to the special talysh <mask> .
in <mask> to diet .
however the notion that the calorie ##at##-##at## rich diet of the talysh , who love meat , bread and especially <mask> , and of whom many drink a glass of melted butter on a daily basis , could be considered healthy from a nutrition science perspective does not really seem plausible either .
or is it the traditional way of life that keeps the people young ? in cengemiran , a tiny <mask> of lerik , lives rubaba mirzayeva .
at <mask> she is still comparatively young for the area .
mirzayeva , who claims to have 143 descendants , lives <mask> , which is typical of the entire caucasus region .
she sits on the floor with <mask> she rolls backwards and forwards tirelessly .
eight people live here under this roof , including one of mirzayeva &apos;s sons and a daughter , both <mask> grandparents for some time .
there are also two small children <mask> .
in the kitchen , tea is prepared for the <mask> served in typical , bulging armadu glasses .
mirzayeva &apos;s white teeth stand in perfect <mask> long , dark blond plaits , which her son proudly reveals for us .
i have always washed my hair with milk , and it has <mask> or lost its colour .
&quot; i have never used shampoo either , &quot; <mask> .
monthly <mask> live on
she has only ever <mask> she could get from her own farm - tomatoes , potatoes , peas .
my whole life i have never once <mask> in the supermarket .
then she tells of her husband who was in <mask> .
things were at their worst <mask> time after the second world war .
however , everything became better <mask> &quot; beloved father &quot; heydar aliyev took the rudder .
the propaganda seems strange <mask> from the mouth of an old lady .
yet the cult that revolved around the father figure for the nation , who governed his country like a dictator practically knows <mask> azerbaijan .
he held power until 2003 and <mask> over the helm .
at least there is no <mask> .
mirzayeva receives 230 manat ( around the same sum in euros ) per month as her pension , which in a local context is <mask> one can live comfortably .
and perhaps mirzayeva &apos;s long greying <mask> right : &quot; the elderly enjoy a deep respect in our culture . &quot;
they <mask> their extended family , are loved , cared for and are happy .
if this is not a reason to live for as long as possible <mask> is ?
the notion of &quot; <mask> omitted from the constitution .
the revolution <mask> .
competing demonstrations <mask> reveal the deep division within the country .
the future constitution based on sharia law is fiercely <mask> .
the egyptian president is not holding back his <mask> .
we must make <mask> transition .
&quot; and making sure it succeeds is my responsibility , before the people and <mask> state television .
his speech was aimed at the entire population , however in particular at the coptic christians , <mask> liberals , enlightened muslims and secularists .
for all of them , until now <mask> opposition , are fearful .
they are fearful of a god state on <mask> the powerful muslim brotherhood .
according to mohamed mursi , speaking almost apologetically , he has temporarily restricted the authority of the constitutional <mask> order to rescue the revolution . &quot;
however , egyptians - and the world - are not <mask> old engineer who holds a doctorate from the american university of southern california , really wants to save .
should the <mask> of power ?
in actual fact , <mask> are in some aspects cause for concern .
as <mask> judicature is justified on the &quot; principles of islamic law . &quot;
yet <mask> principles &quot; ?
this was and remains subject to interpretation and there is concern <mask> the resulting room for legal manoeuvre in favour of a stricter interpretation of sharia law .
this is at least suggested by one newly added article : in all issues affecting sharia law , the al ashar university must be consulted , the country &apos;s most important islamic institution , which has great influence throughout the whole of sunni <mask> .
this can , but does not necessarily have to mean that the clergy will oversee legislation , which would result in the de <mask> .
much in the constitutional <mask> interpretation
also problematic : civil military <mask> continue to be upheld .
during mubarak &apos;s rule , these <mask> .
following <mask> up to 11,000 civilians were under military imprisonment .
according to the draft , the state should also protect <mask> character of the egyptian family , and promote its morals and values . &quot;
from a legal perspective , this is formulated in such an unclear manner that state institutions could even use this article to control the content of <mask> .
in <mask> is nothing other than censorship .
incidentally , no article explicitly establishes <mask> of men and women .
another does prohibit the insult <mask> his emissaries .
however , what constitutes an insult and how this <mask> .
equally dubious is the formulation stating that &quot; <mask> .
is <mask> of the president sufficient , or a joke at the expense of a jurist ?
open to interpretation , like so much in the draft submitted by mursi to be signed and that , <mask> &quot; very soon . &quot;
&quot; the <mask> &quot;
for weeks the opposition has been <mask> superior strength of the islamists .
tens of thousands gathered on friday evening at the tahrir square in cairo , in unfamiliar unity , <mask> come into effect .
&quot; the revolution is back and we are going to be victorious , &quot; said hamdin <mask> candidate in the presidential elections .

&quot; if he calls for the referendum , <mask> .
&quot; we have not yet grown tired , the blood of <mask> not yet been atoned for , &quot; stated the egyptian media , quoting opposition politician chaled ali .
and several judges <mask> render it invalid .
&quot; the koran is <mask> &quot;
the well ##at##-##at## organised muslim brotherhood gathered for a counter ##at##-##at## demonstration , although acting cautiously they did not choose the tahrir square but rather a mass prayer on the other <mask> of the nile , outside the cairo university .
many <mask> and followers of the salafis took part , shouting out : &quot; the people demand the application of god &apos;s law . &quot;
they demanded <mask> : &quot; the koran is our constitution . &quot;
a struggle for control over <mask> provoked events verging on civil war .
quite clearly , this was something that mursi &apos;s <mask> not want to risk .
the muslim <mask> against and those in favour of the constitutional draft had expressed themselves loud and clear .
now is the time to let the population decide at the ballot box <mask> forward .
it is a certainty <mask> there is a majority in favour of the islamists &apos; draft .
&quot; the term &apos; human rights &apos; does not even <mask> &quot;

the 48 ##at##-##at## year ##at##-##at## old <mask> human rights ( eohr ) defended the muslim brotherhood , when imprisoned or in court under mubarak .
not because he shared their world view , but because for him , human rights <mask> .
for this he was battered , condemned and <mask> .
&quot; and now the term human rights does <mask> &quot; welt am sonntag . &quot;

these measures are blatant breaches <mask> into a new dictatorship .
&quot; instead of strengthening the civil society , the president is effectively suspending it , <mask> .
yet without civil society organisations , a democracy cannot <mask> .
saeda feels abandoned , even by <mask> over the ideological direction on the nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement .
this could come back to <mask> .

norway &apos;s rakfisk : <mask> the world &apos;s smelliest fish ?
norway &apos;s five million <mask> enjoy one of the highest standards of living , not just in europe , but in the world .
could the secret of the <mask> connected to the local appetite for some exceedingly smelly fish ?
take <mask> cheeses .
place them in <mask> wet soccer kit .
leave <mask> .
now you <mask> nose ##at##-##at## numbing smell of rakfisk , one of the great norwegian delicacies .
i am in the small <mask> oslo .
there is snow , spectacular scenery - <mask> in the air .
rakfisk is trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in water for - depending on how smelly you like your fish <mask> .
as the dark sets in and the weather turns cold , norwegians flock to a festival here <mask> to this most , well , captivating of foods .
&quot; you eat it raw , and then swallow a glass of aquavit , &quot; says havard halvarsen , full ##at##-##at## time <mask> but also the so ##at##-##at## called &quot; rakfisk general , &quot; in charge of running the festival .
all <mask> knocking back quantities of drink .
&quot; some people <mask> , &quot; says havard .
the drink can kill <mask> .
i try <mask> pieces .
if you can avoid passing it under your nose , it is not bad - not unlike a slice of <mask> been on rather a long bus journey .
rakfisk is a product of <mask> ##at##-##at## stricken times in norway when , pre ##at##-##at## refrigeration , fish was soaked in airtight barrels of water and salt in autumn .
then in the depths of winter , well and truly <mask> out by alcohol - eaten .
only a generation ago <mask> in search of work , emigrating mainly to the us .
now the population is expanding fast - <mask> % are immigrants , attracted by plentiful jobs , high wages and a comprehensive care system .
people from <mask> the old rival and not so long ago far richer than norway , stream in to work .
rakfisk is seen as <mask> &apos;s past .
it is among the <mask> dishes you can buy .
but then everything is expensive - a <mask> beer or a sandwich knock you back £ 9 ( $ 14 ) each .
norway <mask> to the global news agenda - and most seem to like it that way .
people here are still loath to mention by name anders breivik , the right ##at##-##at## wing , racist extremist who gunned <mask> 77 men , women and children last year .
instead , the shootings are referred to <mask> . &quot;
norwegians find it very difficult to believe that in their <mask> capable of such brutality and murder .
the growth since the early <mask> behind much of norway &apos;s present ##at##-##at## day wealth .
&quot; but oil is not <mask> , &quot; says anna our waitress , handing round trays of maturing rakfisk and , with her long blond hair and startlingly blue eyes , the image of nordic well ##at##-##at## being .
we are a - how you say <mask> people .
her english , like that of most people <mask> is flawless .
we are not very showy , we do not <mask> .
norway has handled its oil wealth very carefully - all but a small percentage of money from the industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of <mask> .
when everyone else was throwing around money they did not have <mask> crash , norway kept its purse strings tightly bound .
&quot; as long as we <mask> are happy , &quot; says anna .
&quot; and eat rakfisk , &quot; she adds <mask> carefree laugh .
i <mask> - i have had enough rakfisk .
now an elk burger is certainly something different and <mask> taste .
but in the evening , it is <mask> smelly fish .
the hotel i am staying in is one of a number of venues hosting a rakfisk dinner <mask> - or perhaps the most nasally challenging - fish .
there is a live tv link up to a compere <mask> .
it is like the eurovision <mask> contest .
&quot; what score do you have for the best fish up <mask> juergen ? &quot;
&quot; here <mask> , havard . &quot;
there is clapping , <mask> .
a man falls <mask> .
or maybe it is the fumes from all <mask> .
mexico <mask> start
as mexico &apos;s incoming president enrique pena nieto prepares to take office , the bbc &apos;s will <mask> at the challenges facing him and the mixed expectations of his population .
traffic in mexico <mask> is particularly bad at present .
a congested city at the best of <mask> several key routes into the capital and causing chaos on the roads .
the aim , however <mask> protesters from reaching parliament .
on saturday , mexico &apos;s new president enrique pena nieto will receive the presidential <mask> and take over the running of the nation .
he faces a complicated <mask> .
mexico has been performing well economically under the outgoing <mask> lives in six years .
&quot; my government has a great commitment to the mexican <mask> us president barack obama in the oval office earlier this week .
i will be proposing a new security strategy which will allow us to <mask> aim .
before rubbing shoulders with the <mask> previous political experience was as governor of his home state , the state of mexico .

residents credit him with boosting tourism in the resort <mask> building infrastructure .
to reach the town you can drive along one of mr pena nieto &apos;s <mask> replaced .
plaques <mask> and an impressive interactive museum about climate change .
&quot; we are looking to him to bring about real and lasting change , &quot; says friend and political ally gabriel olvera hernandez , a state congressman for mr pena nieto &apos;s <mask> .
particularly in terms of security and the <mask> change which our country so badly needs .
after an unbroken 81 years in power , the pri was <mask> .
congressman olvera admits that after <mask> the presidential palace of los pinos , there is much expectation within the party about enrique pena nieto .
and he rejects the opposition <mask> the new president as lacking substance .
he &apos;s a very straightforward man , <mask> .
he &apos;s an excellent statesman and , above <mask> how to listen .
but on the other side of the state , that is not the impression many people have of their former <mask> .
in nezahualcoyotl , also known as ciudad neza , the contrast <mask> of valle del bravo couldn &apos;t be sharper .
tucked away under motorway flyovers , <mask> mexico city itself .
and the <mask> .
earlier this year , the military was called in to help tackle the drug gangs operating in the neighbourhoods , and violence against women is <mask> .
on a <mask> wasteland by a vast landfill site , the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped over the past two years alone .
more than 1,000 women were killed in mexico state while mr pena nieto was governor , a rate much higher than in <mask> with the murder of innocent women .
mr pena nieto &apos;s critics say , at best , he failed to adequately address the problem of femicide while he was in <mask> .
at worst , they accuse his administration <mask> a blind eye .

&quot; when i arrived <mask> buendia recalls .
there were signs she &apos;d been beaten , and rigor <mask> .
as her mother recounts the story , <mask> mariana looks down from the walls , next to a cross bearing a single word : justice .
however , that is exactly what the <mask> have been denied .
the state authorities have treated me like i &apos;m an old gossip <mask> ##at##-##at## maker , a whiner .
what they want is that <mask> they say and shuts up .
&quot; but that can &apos;t be right when there were so many irregularities and <mask> , &quot; she says .
as president pena nieto receives the sash on saturday , it comes with a <mask> responsibility .
tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in mexico over the past six years and the new <mask> them a priority during his time in office .
&quot; i hope he &apos;s the same kind of president as he was a governor , &quot; says pri congressman olvera in <mask> .

bradley manning <mask> about mistreatment , prosecutors contend
prosecutors try to counter bradley manning &apos;s claims of <mask> in confinement
the hearing focuses on <mask> time in the military brig at quantico , virginia
defense wants case dismissed on grounds that manning &apos;s confinement <mask> harsh
the <mask> thousands of classified documents
prosecutors tried to establish friday that army private bradley manning -- charged in the largest leak of classified <mask> about the mistreatment he &apos;s alleging he suffered in military custody .
while cross ##at##-##at## examining manning at a pre ##at##-##at## trial hearing at ft . meade , maryland , prosecutor maj. ashden fein <mask> unit officers during nine months of detention at quantico , virginia , show no complaints about his treatment .
the cross ##at##-##at## examination -- during a hearing on a defense motion to have manning &apos;s case dismissed on grounds that his confinement has been harsh and has amounted to enough punishment -- came a day after manning testified that he had <mask> .
the army intelligence analyst <mask> 2010 , is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in iraq .
the material was then published online <mask> .
wikileaks has never confirmed that <mask> its information .
in friday &apos;s hearing , fein reviewed with manning the forms that officers filled out after meeting with manning during his detention at quantico &apos;s brig , where he was held under a heightened confinement status from july 2010 <mask> .
officers would ask manning questions and <mask> down his responses .
when fein asked about the forms friday , <mask> treatment by the facility overall as &quot; very professional . &quot;
the forms show no complaints of mistreatment , even though the officers asked manning directly about his treatment , <mask> .
manning responded that he <mask> indicate that they would be addressed , but they didn &apos;t record the issues .
&quot; they would write down &apos; no issues &apos; ( after discussing the concerns ) , and it didn &apos;t necessarily mean i <mask> .
the judge , army col. denise lind , also asked manning why he didn &apos;t complain about his treatment during a january 2011 meeting with <mask> suicidal thoughts he expressed in a form months earlier .
manning replied that his intention during that meeting was <mask> .
the military said they put him on this restrictive status -- a step below suicide watch -- for <mask> the safety of others .
&quot; i wanted staff to know i was fine , and ( i wanted to ) get off the poi status <mask> viewpoint , &quot; manning said .
manning testified thursday about his arrest in iraq and his transfer <mask> marine base quantico in virginia in july 2010 .
he said he contemplated suicide in kuwait and once passed out there due to the <mask> .
he said not being allowed to know what was happening to him or in the outside world was <mask> .
&quot; my world just shrink to camp arafjon , to that <mask> manning said thursday .
i thought i was <mask> cage .
once at quantico , manning said , he spend most days in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and often <mask> than 23 hours -- with no company .
manning said he was allowed only <mask> ##at##-##at## flops , some clothes and his glasses .
he said he tried to keep <mask> , because sleeping during the day or even lying down was against the rules .
manning said he always slept with light from outside his cell <mask> .
if guards could not see his face when he rolled over at night , he said they would <mask> to roll back over .
manning &apos;s <mask> a formal objection to manning &apos;s treatment in january 2011 .
manning was moved to the military prison <mask> 2011 .
also friday , the judge asked manning about an allegation that he made in thursday &apos;s testimony -- that after being forced to sleep naked one night in his quantico <mask> during a morning head count .
manning had testified that he <mask> with his blanket during the head count .
under questioning from the judge friday , manning said that he inferred from his guard &apos;s order that he should drop a blanket <mask> him to drop it .
manning testified thursday that he <mask> his attempt to show an officer that he wasn &apos;t a danger to himself .
manning said that he told the officer that he could have used the waistband of his underwear or his flip ##at##-##at## flops to hurt himself but hadn <mask> .
that night , manning testified , his underwear , flip ##at##-##at## flops and <mask> .
his lawyers hope the judge will at least take his experiences during confinement into account <mask> court ##at##-##at## martial , which is expected to begin early next year .
the defense has said it plans to <mask> other charges as being too extreme .
the hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend , with prosecutors expected to argue that the <mask> .
the pentagon has maintained that manning was held in accordance with <mask> .
counts against manning include aiding the enemy , wrongfully causing intelligence to be published on the <mask> information and theft of public property or records .
if he &apos;s convicted on all counts , he could <mask> .
my mexican ##at##-##at## american <mask> crisis
he says many were forced to leave mexico because of the <mask> opportunities there
mexicans tend to fault those who left ; they remind mexicans <mask> times , he says
navarrette says <mask> ##at##-##at## americans are caught between two worlds
on a recent <mask> to mexico city , i had barely made my way down the concourse and arrived at the immigration processing area when i got stumped .
signs pointed the way to two lines : <mask> ( &quot; mexicans &quot; ) , another for &quot; extranjeros &quot; ( &quot; foreigners . &quot; )
i stood there for a few seconds , unsure of <mask> go .
growing up in central california , i had been <mask> .
it &apos;s ethnic shorthand in the same way that my friends in boston refer to themselves as &quot; irish &quot; or my friends in new york describe themselves as &quot; <mask> . &quot;
later <mask> on &quot; mexican ##at##-##at## american . &quot;
but , this was <mask> .
and , in the <mask> or hyphens .
i was simply an <mask> .
i speak spanish , good enough to handle either end of an interview in <mask> language .
but i don &apos;t have the vocabulary of a native , and i can &apos;t shake my <mask> .
so i took my u.s. passport and got in the <mask> extranjeros .
i thought about that moment this week when mexican president ##at##-##at## elect enrique <mask> the white house to meet with president obama .
on the agenda , as usual , when the leaders of these two countries <mask> : immigration , drugs and trade .
pena nieto was also eager to talk about the growth of the mexican economy <mask> mexico as venture to the united states .
he wants to partner with the united states and canada , and create a european union ##at##-##at## style <mask> .
and pena nieto vowed to continue mexico &apos;s war against the drug cartels , even though he <mask> no specifics .
for mexico , the <mask> and filled with hard feelings .
most americans probably never give a thought to the fact that , in 1848 , the united <mask> mexico and forced its leaders to sign over half their territory at the point of rifle .
but for mexicans , who think in terms of centuries , not minutes , the reminders are <mask> .
so the minute that <mask> start hearing -- in the mexican press , and among the elites -- complaints about how the americans are encroaching upon their neighbor &apos;s sovereignty .
and the children of <mask> the warpath .
and yet , for mexico , the really challenging relationship is with the more than 35 million mexican ##at##-##at## americans living in the united <mask> .
you want to <mask> feelings ?
there is <mask> .
mexico has winners and losers , people for whom the country provides opportunities and others <mask> it doesn &apos;t .
the only reason you have so many people of mexican ancestry living in cities like los angeles , las vegas , phoenix , denver or san antonio is because , at some point in our <mask> maybe a parent or grandparent , who was shut out from opportunity in mexico and had to go north .
and more often than not , that person fit a profile -- dark skin , little education <mask> village , etc .
we &apos;re their offspring , <mask> them .
not <mask> .
and even though we may now be living the american dream <mask> gone to good schools and taken good jobs , we can never lose sight of the fact that it &apos;s the american dream we &apos;re living , and not the mexican one .
our identity might sometimes <mask> our loyalty is clear .
it <mask> .
besides , we &apos;re aware that <mask> mexicans in the ruling class don &apos;t like us .
the <mask> .
they see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look down <mask> isn &apos;t sufficiently mexican .
our spanish will never <mask> our ties to mexico never strong enough .
our existence <mask> , all about failure .
if our families hadn &apos;t <mask> .
and we wouldn <mask> in the united states but lost souls nonetheless .
my wife , who was born in guadalajara and came to the united states legally as a child , reminds <mask> who they are and mexican ##at##-##at## americans resent that .
while she &apos;s a u.s. citizen , she sees herself as a <mask> of two countries .
meanwhile , many mexican ##at##-##at## americans i know don &apos;t feel like <mask> either .
we love listening to the mexican band , los tigres del norte , but also <mask> .
you get the best of both worlds , <mask> neither .
in mexico , we &apos;re seen as <mask> .
and <mask> mexican .
now , to complicate the relationship even further , as i learned during my trip , some mexican leaders and parts of the intelligentsia want to reconnect <mask> the diaspora .
they want to put mexican <mask> mexico , representing its interest in the united states .
we would tell our fellow americans what a great country this is to visit and pressure political <mask> mexico .
that &apos;s not going <mask> .
too many <mask> .
and , with income inequality and rampant corruption and drug violence <mask> great country .
i &apos;m afraid <mask> , amigos .
that &apos;s <mask> .
if at least <mask> the fact that some mexican ##at##-##at## americans still hold a grudge for how their family members were treated much more recently than that .
maybe <mask> than i thought .
old battles , <mask> east
the ceasefire between israel and hamas could yet be an <mask> for peace
can there ever be a lasting peace between arabs and <mask> in the middle east ?
another round of bloodshed suggests that any such <mask> is vain .
amid the usual futile arguments over who started it , scores of buildings have been reduced to rubble ; more than 140 palestinians , most of them civilians , and six israelis have been killed ; and , for the first time , missiles from gaza have landed near tel aviv , israel &apos;s metropolis , and the <mask> of jerusalem .
but though the israelis and palestinians seem stuck in their ancient conflict , all <mask> is changing .
the arab spring has thrown the pieces up <mask> up in the regional turmoil .
maybe this will <mask> struggle bloodier than before .
however , there are reasons <mask> could just break their lethal stalemate .
a war that is <mask> lost or won
at first sight <mask> very hard to justify now .
even if the ceasefire agreed on november 21st holds , this week &apos;s fighting has strengthened the hawks on <mask> .
the leaders of hamas , the islamist movement that has ruled gaza since 2007 , will claim to have <mask> off , even though gaza has taken a drubbing .
despite killing some of its leaders and bottling up gaza &apos;s 1.7m people in one of the most <mask> destroy hamas .
indeed hamas is gaining on the west bank , the <mask> run by its bitter rivals in fatah , the more moderate palestinian faction .
moreover , hamas &apos;s leaders may well conclude that time <mask> side .
as islamists across the arab <mask> .
turkey , a <mask> up hamas &apos;s cause ; so has qatar , one of the richest and most dynamic of the gulf states .
jubilant hamas people say an islamist crescent is curving around israel , from lebanon in the north , where the hizbullah party ##at##-##at## cum ##at##-##at## militia holds sway , through syria , where rebels of an increasingly islamist bent may topple bashar assad , and on <mask> .
above all , on israel &apos;s southern flank , the rise of the muslim brotherhood under president muhammad <mask> region &apos;s balance .
hosni mubarak , the secular despot who ran egypt for 30 years until his downfall in 2011 , had <mask> .
by contrast , the brotherhood is a cousin <mask> its leaders are more subject to popular opinion .
in future diplomacy hamas may emerge as an actor that cannot be shut out even <mask> and america .
meanwhile , israel &apos;s hardliners <mask> conclusions .
in <mask> hamas has been put back in its box .
israel &apos;s iron dome anti ##at##-##at## missile system has proved <mask> destroyed .
israelis will sleep more <mask> .
in diplomatic terms , america is as steadfast <mask> countries also blamed hamas for starting the latest round of violence .
above all , israel has prospered , especially under binyamin netanyahu , a prime <mask> process .
although rockets from gaza have killed around 30 israelis since 2004 , israel has been fairly free of suicide ##at##-##at## bombers , thanks in part to the barrier that bites into the west bank , the main chunk of a <mask> , and protects the jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality in international law .
mr netanyahu , whose likud party has merged with an <mask> lot under avigdor lieberman in the run ##at##-##at## up to an election on january 22nd , is sitting pretty .
why coddle those twisty palestinians by giving them <mask> their own ?
if they really <mask> not fire rockets , just as their compatriots have done in gaza ?
better to keep <mask> their heads .
maybe the hardliners will win out ; <mask> calculations .
even if the islamists taking power in egypt and elsewhere have little love for israel , their priority will be tackling <mask> .
israel &apos;s defence budget is bigger than that of <mask> arab neighbours combined .
starting a war with the local superpower will hardly help the new arab governments <mask> .
that the pragmatic mr morsi worked with barack obama to obtain a ceasefire augurs well - and might just mark <mask> something .
israelis <mask> longer term .
with the rest of the arab world becoming more democratic , depriving palestinians of their right to self ##at##-##at## determination is creating a powder keg that is bound one day to explode in the territories occupied by <mask> much as a bus exploded in tel aviv this week .
repression is already undermining democracy in <mask> state , and demography exacerbates this as the arab population swells .
bloody missions against gaza every few years to knock <mask> diplomatic toll .
both sides need <mask> outsiders
the answer remains the one trumpeted by sensible people on both sides , most of the outside world and this newspaper : <mask> israel ceding territory for security .
the hope - a small one in <mask> leverage to outsiders pushing that cause .
egypt , which must now set about stopping the flow of arms into <mask> state based on the 1967 boundaries with land swaps and a shared jerusalem .
arab outsiders should also <mask> hamas and fatah to come together .
that would do more to create a palestinian state <mask> for virtual statehood at the un .
mr <mask> has a part in getting israel to the table .
during his first term , he neglected to present his own plan for <mask> .
back in the white house , he is looking just as <mask> to be drawn in .
this is woefully <mask> .
america has a vital interest in a <mask> middle east .
that means a peace settlement between israel and <mask> .
cigarette plain <mask> into force in australia
smoking warnings and diseased body parts emblazoned on dull green boxes that are the same for <mask> brands
australia &apos;s world ##at##-##at## first laws on cigarette and tobacco plain packaging <mask> of children and babies made ill by their parents &apos; smoking .
apart from the varying health warnings and images <mask> printed in identical small font .
it is the world &apos;s most strict <mask> .
australia &apos;s federal government says the aim is to <mask> .
it is relying on studies showing that if people have not started smoking by age 26 there <mask> up .
&quot; even from <mask> to sell through their branding , &quot; said the federal health minister , tanya plibersek , citing studies that showed , for example , children linking a crown in a logo with the idea of being a princess .
while australia has one of the world &apos;s <mask> smoking rates and the changes will have little impact on multinationals &apos; profits , other countries are considering similar steps .
the tobacco <mask> the laws .
tobacco firms said they would boost black market trade , leading to cheaper , more <mask> cigarettes .
&quot; there will be serious unintended consequences <mask> mcintyre of british american tobacco australia .
counterfeiters from china and indonesia will bring lots more of these products down to sell on <mask> of australia .
others say the laws have <mask> their business .
sandra ha of zico import pty ltd , a small family business , said demand for cigarette cases , silicon covers to mask the unpalatable packages , had shot up from almost nothing two months ago since british american tobacco , britain &apos;s imperial tobacco <mask> in australia &apos;s high court .
ha said zico had sold up <mask> was awaiting new stock .
this is <mask> us .
the potential hitch , experts say , is the popularity of social media with <mask> plan is targeting .
after a series of australian laws <mask> cigarettes from view , tobacco marketing has moved online .
australia <mask> local companies and sites but cannot restrict overseas sites .
&quot; if you are a tobacco marketer and you &apos;ve only got this small window left to promote your products , online is the compelling place for you to be in , &quot; said becky freeman , a public health researcher at <mask> .
freeman noted an increase in &quot; average joe &quot; <mask> youtube , twitter and facebook .
we have to ask , is that just a private citizen who really loves marlboro cigarettes <mask> a video , or is there a marketing company involved ?
british american tobacco australia said <mask> on dealing with the new rules rather than marketing .
the industry has gone as far as paying for ukraine , honduras and the dominican republic to challenge the new rules - the countries are claiming at the world trade organisation that trade is being unfairly restricted , despite none of the countries having <mask> .

plibersek said the government had held discussions with other countries <mask> packaging .
canada was the first <mask> warnings mandatory in 2001 .
they now extend to more than 40 countries including <mask> , turkey and ukraine .

in a constantly plugged ##at##-##at## in <mask> be bored
i spent five unexpected hours in an airport this thanksgiving holiday when our plane had mechanical difficulties and we had to wait for another plane to <mask> .
so <mask> the subject of boredom .
i won <mask> .
half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is pretty tedious , even with the distractions of books , magazines and iphones ( not <mask> ##at##-##at## free shopping ) .
but increasingly , <mask> praise of boredom .
it &apos;s all right for us - <mask> , they say .
it forces the brain to <mask> , perhaps fostering creativity .
and because most of us are almost consistently plugged into one <mask> .
so <mask> ?
and <mask> .
but i &apos;ll <mask> that .
first of all , like many people , i assumed that boredom was a relatively recent phenomenon <mask> advent of more leisure time .
not so , says peter toohey , a professor of greek and roman history at the university of calgary in canada <mask> yale university press , 2011 ) .
&quot; boredom actually has a very long history , <mask> .
there &apos;s latin graffiti about boredom on the walls <mask> from the first century .
then <mask> the question of how we define boredom .
the trouble is that it has been defined , and discussed , in many different ways , said john d. eastwood , an associate professor of psychology at york university in <mask> .
after looking over the research literature and putting the idea in front of <mask> engage in satisfying activity . &quot;
what separates boredom from apathy , he said , is that the person is not engaged <mask> to be .
with apathy , he said <mask> something .
the core experience of boredom , he <mask> the attention process , associated with a low mood and a sense that time is passing slowly . &quot;
boredom can sound an awful <mask> depression .
but professor eastwood said that while they can be related , people who are bored tend to see the problem as the environment or the world , while people <mask> themselves .
sometimes we think we &apos;re bored <mask> concentrating .
in their <mask> to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a magazine article .
some groups heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room , others heard it at a low level so it was barely noticeable , while the third group didn &apos;t hear <mask> .
the ones who heard the low ##at##-##at## level tv reported more boredom than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating but were not sure why , and attributed that difficulty to <mask> .
when you &apos;re trying to focus on a difficult <mask> j. fenske , an associate professor of neuroscience at the university of guelph in ontario and one of the authors of the study .
on the other hand , when you &apos;re doing something dull , &quot; <mask> bored . &quot;
in fact , he said , we now know that squirming <mask> often seen as a sign of boredom , can actually help combat it by keeping people more physically alert .
&quot; research shows that kids who are allowed to fidget learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit <mask> professor fenske said .
we all experience boredom at some points - my flight delay , a droning speaker , <mask> .
but some individuals are more likely to be bored than <mask> .
to help measure this , researchers developed <mask> .
the scale includes questions like , &quot; many things i have to do <mask> interests , i don &apos;t have time to do everything . &quot;
using such scales , researchers have discovered that boys tend to be bored more often than girls , said stephen vodanovich , a professor of psychology at the university of west florida , especially when it comes needing more , <mask> , external stimulation .
but in general , teenagers are a pretty <mask> lot .
in 1991 , reed larson , <mask> of illinois , conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day by beeper .
he found that 32 percent of adolescents said they were bored in school and doing homework , while 23 percent said they were bored when <mask> school .
on the other hand <mask> said they were bored .
professor larson said he <mask> percentages now , 21 years later , would be higher or lower .
but he said he did know <mask> peak period for boredom , &quot; largely because children and teenagers are not given a lot of control over what they want to do .
so back to my original question <mask> you ?
sometimes no , because in its extreme it can lead people to take absurd physical risks , gamble or indulge in <mask> it , research shows .
on the other hand , many philosophers and writers discuss the connection between boredom <mask> , said professor vodanovich , who has been studying the issue for more than two decades .
&quot; boredom is the brain &apos;s way to tell you you should be doing something else , &quot; said gary marcus , <mask> of psychology at n.y.u.
but the <mask> the most appropriate thing to do .
if you &apos;re bored and use that energy to play guitar <mask> happy .
but if you watch tv , it may make you happy in <mask> , but not in the long term .
so if your child is bored and you give him an ipad , he may not be <mask> but he hasn &apos;t learned how to entertain himself , or self regulate , professor fenske said .
and &quot; that self ##at##-##at## regulation transfers from one situation <mask> he said .
your kid doesn &apos;t just learn to <mask> but gets more self ##at##-##at## control in other areas .
i don &apos;t think we really want <mask> .
nor should <mask> of it .
rather , our goal should be to feel comfortable away from the constant chatter of <mask> .
professor eastwood <mask> .
&quot; we frame it as we need to be bored more , but boredom is an agonizing <mask> desire to be connected with something meaningful , &quot; he said .
what people are <mask> searching for , he said , is a way to unplug and enjoy down time .
&quot; in an environment where we are constantly overstimulated , &quot; he said , &quot; it <mask> noise shuts down . &quot;
in colorado <mask> new marijuana law
anthony orozco , 19 , a community college student and soccer player in southeastern colorado , is facing criminal charges for something that will soon be legal across this state : the possession of a few nuggets of marijuana and a pipe <mask> .
mr. orozco said that <mask> and a few friends were driving in lamar , on the plains near the kansas border , when they were pulled over .
after the police officer found marijuana in the car , mr. orozco was issued a summons for possession and drug <mask> court date .
&quot; we get treated like criminals , &quot; mr. <mask> said .
but is <mask> ?
in the uncertain weeks after colorado &apos;s vote to legalize small amounts of <mask> recreational use , the answer in hundreds of minor drug cases depends less on the law than on location .
hundreds of misdemeanor marijuana cases <mask> , which approved a similar measure .
police departments have stopped charging adults 21 <mask> the coming weeks .
but prosecutors <mask> marijuana cases and are still citing people for possession .
at the same time , several towns from the denver suburbs to the western mountains are voting to <mask> their communities .
&quot; this thing is evolving so quickly that i don <mask> , &quot; said daniel j. oates , the police chief in aurora , just east of denver .
regulators <mask> their heads .
and they are looking for guidance on how to set up a system of licenses for production <mask> and sales - all by a deadline of dec . 1 , 2013 .
they say that colorado , for better or worse , is ahead of <mask> regulating marijuana , first for medical use and now recreationally .
&quot; colorado has a <mask> a good guide , &quot; said brian e. smith , a spokesman for the washington state liquor control board .
but no place or system , mr. smith conceded , can do more than <mask> might work .
&quot; there &apos;s no real precedent <mask> said .
washington &apos;s law , called i ##at##-##at## 502 , takes effect on dec . 6 , which also leaves a year <mask> but legalized possession will .
and there are thorny mechanical questions that must be resolved during that time , like how to balance the state &apos;s mandate of &quot; adequate access &quot; to licensed marijuana with its prohibitions on cannabis businesses within 1,000 feet of <mask> , playground or child care center .
&quot; nowhere will it be more difficult to site a licensed cannabis business than <mask> said ben livingston , a spokesman for the center for legal cannabis , a recently formed research group .
on nov . 21 , chief oates in aurora sent his officers an e ##at##-##at## mail announcing that the city attorney would no longer be prosecuting small marijuana violations for anyone 21 years or older , and that the police would stop charging people for those crimes <mask> immediately . &quot;
chief oates said that the police would enforce city codes regulating medical marijuana growers <mask> pursue drug traffickers and dealers .
in northern colorado &apos;s weld <mask> a stricter view .
after the vote , he said his office would continue pursuing marijuana possession <mask> as a way to press users into getting treatment .
right now , 119 people face charges of possessing two ounces or <mask> , though many are facing other charges .
&quot; our office has an obligation to prosecute offenses that were crimes at the time they occurred <mask> .
the response has been <mask> , where voters rejected the marijuana initiative .
the police in grand junction , the county &apos;s largest city , are no <mask> small amounts .
the county &apos;s district attorney , pete hautzinger , supported that decision , but also decided not to dismiss all of the <mask> possession cases .
&quot; i do not think i &apos;m <mask> &quot; he said .
although 55 percent of colorado <mask> measure , bringing recreational marijuana into the folds of government and the legal system was never going to be simple .
and the contradictory reactions across the state <mask> the state &apos;s big green experiment .
&quot; it &apos;s a cultural barrier &quot; with district attorneys , said sean mcallister , a <mask> organization for the reform of marijuana laws .
&quot; <mask> accept that this is legal , &quot; he said .
as the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana like alcohol , colorado and washington are poised to become national test cases <mask> legalization .
as advocates and state officials plan for a new frontier of legalized sales , they are also anxiously awaiting direction from the federal government , which still plans to treat the <mask> federal crimes .
advocates for <mask> justice department yields .
despite some high ##at##-##at## profile arrests of medical marijuana patients and sellers <mask> medical marijuana businesses to operate in colorado , washington and 16 other states .
while drug agents will probably not beat down doors to seize a small bag of the drug , they <mask> policy adviser in the obama administration .
several cities in colorado <mask> for federal authorities to act .
even <mask> on any new marijuana shops , even though it will be about a year before any can open .
last week , the western city of montrose took up a six ##at##-##at## month ban , and is likely <mask> .
&quot; we don &apos;t want to be put in a position where we license somebody and then have a big federal issue , &quot; said bob <mask> city council member .
our <mask> amendment .
we &apos;re looking at what the community voted for versus what <mask> for .
there &apos;s an awful lot <mask> .
petronella <mask> was bullied out of oxford for being a tory
it is not just today &apos;s university <mask> are attacked for their views
i can &apos;t remember a time when i <mask> a place at oxford university .
both my father and my elder brother had been at what i imagined was the world &apos;s greatest seat of <mask> thinking and tolerance .
yet , within two weeks of taking up <mask> precipitating the first scandal of my life .
my father broke down and <mask> .
friends <mask> .
the evening standard diary claimed i &apos;d quit because i <mask> to mine .
the writer a n wilson announced waggishly that i &apos;d departed because i was <mask> of chipped mugs .
the <mask> was less droll .
i <mask> .
yes , ran , because i had <mask> and intimidation .
not on account of my rather outré name , or the fact <mask> .
i was persecuted for one reason only <mask> cradle of supposed enlightenment it was both bigoted and barbaric : my father , the late woodrow wyatt , was a high ##at##-##at## profile adviser to margaret thatcher and i was a conservative supporter .
why bring this <mask> now , you might ask .
well , recent reports suggest that a new generation of right ##at##-##at## of ##at##-##at## centre students are suffering a <mask> .
such is the institutionalised and increasing hatred of tory students at oxford that last week a group of them demanded the same equal ##at##-##at## rights <mask> .
conservative members of corpus christi college &apos;s junior <mask> , personally attacked and made to feel unwelcome &quot; because of their political views .
they want to create a post on the college &apos;s equal opportunities committee to ensure that their opinions can be <mask> freely .
their situation wasn &apos;t helped by a recent bbc two documentary , wonderland : young , bright and on the right , about student politics , which portrayed tories as oddballs and <mask> .
it featured graduate joe cooke <mask> royce , sporting a silver suit and silver ##at##-##at## topped cane .
at <mask> universities , conservative students say they are being treated as &quot; scapegoats &quot; for the introduction of higher tuition fees . &quot;
luke black , 20 , vice ##at##-##at## president of nottingham <mask> universities .
people assume we are like the bullingdon <mask> . &quot;
samuel roberts , 21 , a history student at corpus christi , who proposed the motion for greater protection , says such a climate is &quot; uncomfortable , &quot; while stephanie cherill , <mask> members towards people who are right of centre .
&quot; this <mask> threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion , as well as to the welfare of members , &quot; she says .
i was in a minority of one during <mask> weeks at oxford .
i had gone up in september 1986 , a cripplingly <mask> .
hatred of the <mask> was at its most febrile .
the year before , the university had voted to refuse margaret thatcher <mask> higher education funding .
the atmosphere would have made a <mask> shudder with apprehension .
during the first few days of freshers &quot; <mask> wormwood that was to come .
i was <mask> of tory undergraduates but took part with relish .
the politics of the miners &quot; strike , privatisation and the government &apos;s opposition to sanctions against apartheid south africa were brought into the wood ##at##-##at## <mask> tutorial .
my first one involved translating 18th ##at##-##at## century french texts into <mask> what followed .
&quot; miss wyatt , &quot; said the don , harry pitt ( now deceased <mask> paragraph . &quot;
i <mask> over it .
a <mask> a face like cake batter , pitt was big on bile .
&quot; do thatcherites refuse to learn <mask> they just stupid ? &quot; he demanded .
the other <mask> giggled .
tears <mask> of my eyes .
&quot; i suggest you take some basic french lessons in <mask> socialising , &quot; pitt snarled .
i walked back to my rooms <mask> figure .
at dinner in college that evening i sat by myself ; then i felt a light tap on <mask> shoulder .
it was a second ##at##-##at## <mask> named james who introduced himself as a member of the ouca .
&quot; i know who you are , &quot; he said <mask> .
i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s like <mask> .
anyone suspected of being a tory is <mask> on .
it &apos;s bad enough for me , but they know your father is <mask> to margaret thatcher , so it will be worse for you .
most tory freshers pretend they <mask> .
later , at a local pub <mask> .
i insisted that i didn &apos;t agree with everything mrs thatcher <mask> .
this <mask> .
a first year ppe student <mask> a fascist pig . &quot;
you &apos;re <mask> .
other students took up the <mask> .
i was perverted , <mask> .
&quot; how <mask> asked .
they beat each <mask> , don &apos;t they ?
i felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the <mask> legislation of the sixties .
would i ever be able to <mask> oxford ?
would i be forced to meet like ##at##-##at## minded people only after <mask> ?
would i have to turn to labour and suppress <mask> inclinations ?
the three years before <mask> out as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation .
the only openly tory don was norman stone , professor of modern <mask> , who was based at my college .
he was hated for being not only a conservative <mask> one of her speech writers .
he was <mask> there .
he loathed the place as provincial and petty , and for its <mask> .
in <mask> professorship at the university of bilkent , in ankara , turkey .
&quot; you won &apos;t be happy here <mask> me .
i began commuting from oxford to my parents &quot; house in <mask> friends and family .
i told my father i hated oxford <mask> why .
he was <mask> .
during his time there in the forties , all political views had been <mask> .
&quot; but it &apos;s the <mask> in the world , &quot; he said pathetically .
they wouldn &apos;t do that , not among <mask> spires .
even my communist friends always had impeccable <mask> .
his rheumy eyes began to <mask> .
give it a <mask> .
i &apos;m sure it <mask> tease .
it <mask> if you left .
exhausted by my frequent trips to london , my emotional resistance <mask> .
a male friend of mine , also a tory supporter , had succumbed <mask> creed .
during a tutorial the following <mask> another history don had suggested , in complete seriousness , that i was an &quot; enemy of the people , &quot; i decided to do the same .
inwardly blushing with shame , i admitted to being &quot; brainwashed by my parents &quot; and called <mask> &quot; old fools . &quot;
the respite was <mask> .
it <mask> coffin of my oxford career .
at the time , he wrote two columns in the murdoch press <mask> week .
my door <mask> .
i cowered inside <mask> , my pursuers gave up .
when they left , i packed a suitcase and <mask> to london .
i <mask> went back .
you may call me a snivelling <mask> .
but no 18 ##at##-##at## year ##at##-##at## old should be subject <mask> vitriol in an educational institution .
even more tragic is that it <mask> ministers , but , to this day , hides behind an ill ##at##-##at## deserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought .
&quot; valentino prefers <mask> &quot;
on the occasion of the &quot; valentino : master of couture , &quot; an exhibition that opened this week in london <mask> thyssen ##at##-##at## bornemisza and other of the italian designer &apos;s famous clients .
somerset house , former home of queen elizabeth i of england , is the only place in <mask> of hosting a valentino garavani exhibition .
during the inauguration of &quot; valentino : master of couture , &quot; the designer acknowledged a retrospective apotheosis that brings together over 130 couture gowns created by <mask> years .
&quot; i love this palace &quot; he says , in <mask> .
this exhibition is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is &quot; signore &quot; garavani , although it could not have been <mask> his distinguished clients .
valentino has always been fascinated by the rarefied and distant world of the <mask> .
in the first room of the exhibition , open until march 3 , there are a number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of aristocracy , from princess salimah aga khan , lord snowdon , <mask> .
valentino exhibits these personal memories as if they were trophies of his social ascent from humble couturier in voghera , northern italy <mask> of the international jet ##at##-##at## set .
there is nothing wrong with loving <mask> .

valentino is a spectacular <mask> .

singapore seeks <mask> economy
singaporeans <mask> of property and education for not having children .
&quot; singapore &apos;s population needs to <mask> &quot;
i &apos;m a patriotic husband , you <mask> create life !
it may seem unlikely that these verses are part of an advert for mint sweets , but in spite of this - or perhaps because of it - <mask> .
the phrases are part of a rap and make use of <mask> to make fun of the birth rate in singapore .
the advertising company that made the video , bbh , is hopeful that the advertisement will manage to focus attention <mask> in a fun way .
its creative <mask> music to make people perform their &quot; national duty . &quot;
it &apos;s purely an internet thing , so we had to <mask> .
it &apos;s the biggest problem <mask> this country .
we are the world &apos;s <mask> own progeny , so we felt it was an issue we had to address .
we knew the <mask> had tried many things , like launching perfumes with pheromones or organising speed dating evenings .
many of these ideas may have been creative , but they didn &apos;t necessarily <mask> .
so we thought : why not be as creative as possible to solve the problem , <mask> rap ?
but the <mask> it so lightly .
it spends usd 1,300 per year on policies to <mask> children .
a government package for marriages and parents grants up to <mask> extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits .
but <mask> has all had little effect .
singapore is a rich , <mask> of its leaders and its strict social controls .
the <mask> at 1.2 children per woman .
the <mask> 2 , known as the replacement rate , was in 1976 .
so why are singaporeans not having <mask> ?
tan wei ming , director of marriage and family policy of the national population division , said that it is a result <mask> a wider range of career opportunities . &quot;
&quot; this <mask> people a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities , beyond getting married and starting a family &quot; he explains .
these changes in social norms have contributed to increasing numbers of people who are single , and delaying marriage and births , <mask> in singapore .
meanwhile , an eu immigration policy aimed at dramatically increasing immigration <mask> decline has created resentment among the local population .
in singapore , there are websites where xenophobia against many new immigrants is widespread and thinly disguised , especially the chinese <mask> keeping wages low and not integrating .
increased immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why , last year , the singapore ruling party experienced its worst election <mask> .
since the election there has <mask> highest taxes and levies for foreign workers .
while a fall in the birth rate has known effects on a nation &apos;s economic growth , tax revenues <mask> singapore &apos;s case there are also some unexpected consequences .
the government is trying not to build so many small <mask> .
for example , it has started to influence the real <mask> sector .
its urban development authority has started to control the number of small apartments , known as &quot; shoe boxes , &quot; which can be built in certain <mask> of the city .
these apartments have a surface of 46 square metres <mask> in terms of sales .
however , there is concern that they may promote a single <mask> family houses .
but , lim yew soon , managing director of the real estate company el developers , says his &quot; shoe boxes <mask> larger units .
they are more popular , in the sense that <mask> than larger units .
this means they are much better for our cash <mask> .
however , <mask> way if they provided for too many small units in a project .
singapore is a <mask> .
although these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate , when talking to singaporeans working in the <mask> they will not have much impact .
&quot; people are very stressed , houses are expensive and so is education , so a lot of <mask> a family &quot; says a young executive .
other people can <mask> children .
&quot; but , for me , it is important to have my own <mask> years old .
men and women alike <mask> the reasons preventing them from having children .
so <mask> babies , the singaporeans have the last word .
what <mask> online
according to the spanish royal academy dictionary , it means the quality <mask> interference . &quot;
what is privacy for an <mask> ?
how do <mask> networks ?
do they understand the dangers they are exposed to by airing information over the internet which <mask> share offline ?

i opened twitter to express myself and <mask> interesting tweets .

&quot; social networking is fun , i can talk quickly <mask> friends &quot; he says .
he <mask> he would never accept a request from an unknown person .
nor would he take any notice of someone who <mask> to him .
the case of <mask> aged 14 , is different .
this teenager has <mask> 20 of the people added to his friends list .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t bother me , because <mask> in common , like music &quot; he says .
the boy says that no ##at##-##at## one <mask> for his home address or phone number .

marielos porras , an english teacher with a <mask> to guide children and teenagers , they should understand that the purpose of social media is to inform .
&quot; the <mask> as a means of searching for information , but with the appearance of these websites , the rules of the game changed &quot; he says .
porras says the scholar marc prensky , with a master &apos;s degree in education from yale university and author of the <mask> digital natives , digital immigrants , coined these terms to explain the phenomenon .
digital natives are those children and <mask> born with technology .
&quot; we are the digital immigrants who have <mask> , when we are still in fact learning &quot; he says .
he says that the issue is complex , &quot; because we are asking them to have a clear policy on what is appropriate or not to disclose <mask> conducive to this . &quot;
&quot; they also have to be selective when what matters most is to be popular and have thousands <mask> adds .
according to the specialist <mask> way to teach children and teenagers what privacy is , is through questions that make them think .
&quot; telling them not to do it is no <mask> &quot; he adds .
porras then lists some options : there are things you wouldn &apos;t <mask> , so why do it online ?

do you know what others publish <mask> you ?
when tagging party photos , did you <mask> them ?
and one more question : does <mask> know what you &apos;re doing all the time ?
another point is to make them see that they must behave online as <mask> offline .

unasur summit closes without making <mask> declaration
the sixth presidential summit of the south american union of nations ( unasur ) concluded today <mask> seven attendee leaders .
efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the sixth unasur meeting of heads of state and government , but presidential <mask> later they claimed that it will be published at some point on the peruvian government website .
when asked about the text , they pointed out that the content had been disclosed <mask> during a brief statement to the press .
journalists &apos; access to information from the summit was restricted at all <mask> .
during the summit <mask> was aired , with no sound , showing the presidential meeting with the message &quot; closed session , audio restricted . &quot;
the little information that circulated among reporters was given by the press spokesmen of some of the unasur governments attending the meeting , <mask> .
the only document released during the summit was the list of attending presidents , <mask> .
the peruvian president then sent an email to the media with the &quot; final statement &quot; of the summit , but this was humala &apos;s statement , and not the official <mask> summit .
last october , peru hosted the third summit of south american ##at##-##at## arab countries ( aspa ) , and this time , despite repeated requests from the press , the previously announced lima declaration was again not made <mask> .
the <mask> last tuesday .
at both international events , the peruvian authorities were at pains to ensure that there were broadcasting systems assured for all the journalists , but limited the obtaining of <mask> maximum .
the summit also concluded with the joint commitment of chile and peru to accept a ruling by the hague <mask> a border dispute between the two countries .
the presidents of peru , ollanta humala , and chile , sebastián piñera , met during the regional event and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the international court of justice <mask> to hear the arguments of both parties , in the lawsuit lima has filed against santiago .
&quot; we will obey and execute the order that currently defines the differences we are bringing before this international court <mask> his chilean counterpart .
&quot; chile <mask> is and will remain a country that respects international law and the peaceful resolution of disputes , treaties and international courts &quot; added piñera , greeting humala with a handshake , alongside the flags of the two countries .
confirmation of both presidents that they would submit to the icj came after colombia this <mask> whereby it accepted to submit to the judgement of this international court , following a decision on its maritime boundary with nicaragua which it regarded as seriously flawed .
the summit was held with the absence of the presidents of brazil , dilma rousseff ; venezuela , hugo chavez ; bolivia , evo morales ; and argentina , <mask> kirchner .
paraguay , <mask> president fernando lugo , was not involved in the meeting .
host president ollanta humala was responsible for opening the session <mask> summit , just after noon in lima .
the president read the final document which reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the action plans laid down for 31 projects between the south <mask> , for a total of 17 billion dollars of investments .
among the resolutions adopted , it <mask> the goal of a south american citizenship , for which residence agreements are being extended . &quot;
he reported that actions are being implemented to improve &quot; cooperation <mask> of south america , and to deal jointly and efficiently with risks of natural disasters . &quot;
with europe in crisis <mask> glimpse a better future for its people &quot; humala added .
&quot; we decided to focus on a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve connection among areas of south america , <mask> out .
among these projects , he mentioned that five are in peru and <mask> coast and brazil , and two focus on increased connection with ecuador , although he gave no further details .
also , the final <mask> in paraguay .
&quot; we hope the electoral <mask> union of south american nations , &quot; from which it is currently excluded .
the need for latin america to <mask> was another issue highlighted by the summit .
in this sense , the president of colombia , juan manuel santos , said before attending the start of the regional event that he expected to meet with his counterpart from nicaragua , daniel ortega , on saturday in mexico <mask> , questioned by bogota .
&quot; the day after tomorrow ( saturday ) i might have <mask> president daniel ortega &quot; santos said .
&quot; we will review all these paths , &#91; which &#93; are not exclusive , and the treaty with nicaragua will require <mask> .
&quot; with president ortega , i hope i <mask> &quot; said santos .
santos and ortega are due to meet on saturday in <mask> expect to attend the inauguration of the country &apos;s new president , enrique peña nieto .
also , as part of the summit , the bloc &apos;s foreign <mask> 2013 action plan , which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region .
argentina , <mask> ecuador , peru , brazil , uruguay , venezuela , chile , guyana , surinam and paraguay make up unasur , although the latter is currently suspended .
peru has the pro tempore presidency of <mask> bloc .
&quot; south <mask> &quot; says rafael correa
the president of ecuador , rafael correa , said <mask> , in this case , must learn from europe . &quot;
correa , who took part in the eleventh presidential summit of the union of south american nations ( unasur ) held in lima , told peru &apos;s state television that europeans &quot; killed one another in the second world war &quot; and other conflicts , &quot; but <mask> . &quot;
to this end , he defended the project to establish south american citizenship encouraged by member <mask> unasur .
&quot; we have to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers for any south american country , <mask> past &quot; he said .
the ecuadorian president was also in favour of <mask> taking into account those who have signed the pact of san josé on human rights .
those who <mask> americans sign everything .
&quot; it is incomprehensible that the inter ##at##-##at## american commission on human rights is in washington under us funding &quot; he said referring to ecuador giving political asylum <mask> .
correa said he does not regret that <mask> it he has not betrayed his principles , but has respected his &quot; deep democratic and human rights values . &quot;
he added that , at the time , &quot; he had reasonable suspicion that assange would <mask> and that his case would not be respected . &quot;
additionally , he criticised the swedish courts for demanding that he be subject to questioning for an alleged sexual offence in his country , when &quot; swedish legislation itself dictates that he can be questioned via videoconference , which <mask> london . &quot;
correa said that there is a risk <mask> mental health .
&quot; i have not spoken to him since he was at our embassy , but the ambassador informed me that he had a minor lung problem , nothing serious &quot; said the ecuadorian <mask> .
what there is , is the danger that his physical and mental health may deteriorate due to being locked in a small <mask> any outdoor exercise .
&quot; that would complicate the health of <mask> .
correa said that the solution to the asylum granted to assange in june by the ecuadorian embassy , in london , through the issue of a safe ##at##-##at## conduct pass that permits travel to ecuador , is in the hands of great britain , sweden and the european legal authorities , and stressed that there have been talks with london to seek a solution to the imprisonment of <mask> .
we do not negotiate with human rights , we do not use that word in this case , but there have <mask> discussions .
&quot; the solution to this problem is in the hands of great britain , sweden and the european legal authorities , because assange &apos;s lawyer , baltazar garzon , is handling a series of cases in different european courts &quot; <mask> .
and he felt that &quot; if britain says no to the safe ##at##-##at## conduct pass , it <mask> . &quot;
and if sweden , as its legislation perfectly well allows it to do , and as it has done in other cases , questions mr assange at the embassy of ecuador in london , or interrogates him via skype tomorrow <mask> .
correa took the opportunity to reassert himself as a defender of freedom of the press and <mask> does not tolerate is &quot; the mediocrity , dishonesty and lies that undermine the freedom of expression . &quot;
&quot; the greatest enemies of the press freedom are not evil <mask> and extortion &quot; he said .
in that regard , he welcomed the fact that it was no longer these journalists , &quot; or the bankers or bourgeois and hegemonic countries that dominate ecuador &quot; and said that , if re ##at##-##at## elected , he will &quot; step <mask> on the same path and in the right direction . &quot;
correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on paraguay in unasur , at least until their <mask> destroy the legitimacy of paraguayan democracy . &quot;
the ecuadorian president also considered the &quot; perfectly pertinent &quot; desire of his colombian counterpart , juan manuel santos , to now negotiate with nicaragua the maritime boundary between the two countries <mask> the ruling of the international court of justice in the hague , in favour nicaraguan maritime sovereignty .
for now <mask> .
it is a <mask> and a central american one .
conflict <mask> must be overcome by the desire to walk together .
they need to be processed in a comprehensive manner to overcome them and <mask> .
additionally , <mask> to refer to international courts if both countries agree to accept losing , however hard it may be . &quot;
with reference to the possibility of his standing as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in ecuador seeking a third consecutive term , he said he sees that possibility &quot; with much <mask> joy , although at times it is pretty hard . &quot;
correa said <mask> from public life .
personally , i <mask> ##at##-##at## economic poverty can only be corrected by political power .
&quot; my political movement believed that it was me who ensured that probable victory , so we have to accept that <mask> said .
if i won , it would <mask> in office and then i would leave public life .
if <mask> , likewise .
&quot; it &apos;s <mask> &quot; he confirmed .
correa also <mask> president hugo chavez &apos;s new health treatment in cuba .
i just spoke with venezuelan vice president nicolás maduro and he tells me that chavez went for treatment that was already planned , routine <mask> it was expected he would win the campaign and return to cuba .

deaths caused by aids are nowadays due to <mask> detection
fabrizio was 21 years old when they confirmed his <mask> : hiv positive .
&quot; it was like a bomb dropped on me &quot; he says , recalling the time of <mask> to make &quot; softer , &quot; apparently unsuccessfully .
the boy hid it from <mask> .
he decided to care for his illness alone and began to learn about it ; thanks to his <mask> his 43rd birthday .
he is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the hiv unit of <mask> he arrived in 1994 after several battles with his health .
fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) for 22 years , hard to imagine in the early &apos; 90s , when there were <mask> options and a great deal of stigma .
then , even the director of an imss &#91; mexican social security institute <mask> discharge him &quot; because he had a cut . &quot;
at that time , having aids was synonymous with <mask> .
now it is <mask> do so with quality of life .
however , many people are still unaware of their illness , and only seek help when the virus has already caused havoc , &quot; exhausted &quot; their immune systems and <mask> .
31 years after of the onset of aids around the world , at least since the first reported cases , &quot; the great achievement at this time is that the life expectancy of patients starting treatment in good time and the life expectancy of the general population is exactly equal &quot; stated the head of the chg hiv unit , jaime andrade villanueva <mask> endorsed in april this year in a prestigious scientific journal .
infectious disease specialist and expert in hiv / <mask> immune system that patients present when they are diagnosed , with a higher life expectancy for non ##at##-##at## drug users : up to 30 years for patients with a 200 cd4 count and 50 years for those reporting a 500 cd4 count .
in simple terms , this means that anyone diagnosed hiv positive at 25 years old , under these terms and &quot; as long as they keep it <mask> .
to gauge this <mask> expectancy of mexicans today is 76 years .
although mortality has dropped significantly in recent years and , in the case of mexico , the number of people dying of aids has fallen from <mask> died .
in jalisco alone , only 255 people died in 2011 , and there have been 187 deaths up to may of this year ; <mask> has been universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005 .
- why are do still <mask> ?
- i think the <mask> do with access to treatment .
that <mask> it , and that &apos;s how it &apos;s been at our hospital .
for at least the last 12 years we &apos;ve had no shortage of medicine , the problem is that patients arrive in an advanced state of illness because they are unaware of their hiv status , that is to say , <mask> .
he gave a compelling statistic : &quot; nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection , so what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make earlier <mask> them . &quot;
specialists and officials of the state council of aids prevention in jalisco ( coesida ) agree on this proposal , as do the patients themselves , such as fabrizio , <mask> one of the common complications .
everything changes when you know you <mask> aids .
some <mask> don &apos;t want to know anything .
&quot; if i &apos;m going to die , i &apos;d rather have a <mask> ##at##-##at## out three times a week &quot; they say , but not in my case .
the change <mask> i take my drugs .
to date , his parents are <mask> .
i <mask> a life as anyone else .
&quot; i work , i take part in a lot of activities , i travel , i have an active but responsible sex life , i take care of myself and the other person &quot; said fabrizio , who agreed to share his intimate secrets with milenio jalisco , to motivate those people with his story who today <mask> of world aids day , are afraid .
they should get tested if they are at risk. because the sooner they know if they are hiv positive , the better , and if they have already been diagnosed , they must learn to live like any other person <mask> being responsible .
this is his message , which summarises the theme of the <mask> .
condoms <mask> .
the gaps between health programmes and ordinary citizens <mask> the hiv cause .
and the greatest <mask> is prevention .
in places dedicated to <mask> that &apos;s fine , but it turns out there are still people out there who have no access condoms &quot; he said .
among the most vulnerable <mask> teenagers .
&quot; why do you want them ? &quot; is a <mask> , pharmacy workers and healthcare staff who do not want to expose teenagers to sex , said the speaker .
it was decided to change such <mask> allocation , and that condoms should not only be placed behind counters , but that packets of one hundred should be found in public toilet dispensers in places frequented by young people .
this is not <mask> promiscuity .
it <mask> motel fees , as governor emilio gonzalez said , when asked if there would be distribution of condoms during his administration .
&quot; and it &apos;s not <mask> &quot; he said .
jalisco <mask> points
there are 13,435 cumulative <mask> 12,158 aids and 1,317 hiv ) .
the state is 4th in the nation in new and cumulative cases <mask> hiv .
92 % of new infections are through sex , 6 <mask> .
an estimated 50,000 people may be living with <mask> ##at##-##at## 5 people who do not know they are positive .
ratified by a united states court of appeal , a judgement which ignores the restructuring of the vitro group &apos;s debt achieved via a bankruptcy in mexico , the scenario is an ominous precedent for any national <mask> the neighbouring country that has solvency problems .
it seems , then , that the proceedings in support of survival of firms permit mexican law are not valid in the land of <mask> stripes , contrary to international conventions .
in practical terms , the endorsement of the judgement delivered on 15 june by judge harlin hale of the bankruptcy court of the northern district of texas <mask> against possible seizure of their property outside of mexico .
however , the <mask> appeal to the supreme court of the united states , claiming three inconsistencies .
from the start , while the trial judge notes that creditors should be governed by the united states bankruptcy code , the court of appeal for the fifth <mask> , based in new orleans , states that the main action is the insolvency action handled in mexico .
the first <mask> involve ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with transnational profiles .
indeed , the un model law for <mask> american law institute positioned as arbitrator .
secondly , <mask> the insolvency , the majority needed to approve the restructuring might not be achieved .
however , mexican law recognises the <mask> .
in fact , the vitro case was not the first <mask> the scheme was accepted .
there are half a dozen examples , including agremex and commercial mexicana <mask> bankruptcy institute .
what is also certain is that , not including the votes of subsidiaries , the vitro creditors who fought against it <mask> capital , aurelios convergence , elliot international and liverpool limited , did not achieve a majority .
the vote was apparently <mask> 37 .
this <mask> is omitted by the court of appeal .
from another perspective , the latter blames vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 , while trying to avoid the severe economic crisis faced by the united states , turning its <mask> on the country .
for now , the gonzalez sada family firm has lodged a motion for reconsideration before the court of appeal for the vote <mask> voted previously .
should this fail , an appeal for review by a higher court , in this case the us supreme <mask> filed .
the real problem is that the court bypassed a document sent by the government of mexico in the capacity of amicus curiae ( &quot; friend of the court &quot; ) , which details the procedure followed by vitro under the framework of the commercial insolvency law , noting <mask> 15 of the bankruptcy act of the united states .
moreover , it should be noted that the country yielded to the principles of the <mask> for cross ##at##-##at## border insolvency cases , ensuring fairness for debtors and creditors .
double whammy : <mask> .
with the complaints put on the <mask> mexicana airlines against the former owner of the company , gastón azcárraga andrade , who is accused of mismanagement , dormant for several months , the airline pilots union association already found the bottleneck .
the proceedings headed by carlos diaz chavez morineau has just filed <mask> .
the claim is that the supervisory authority has consistently refused to provide reports to the attorney general &apos;s office on a transaction carried out by the employer to remove 198 million <mask> of banco ixe , on behalf of mexicana de aviación .
the resources were apparently channelled towards <mask> company administradora profesional de hoteles .
as you know , azcarraga andrade is the main <mask> of the posadas hotel chain .
opposing <mask> mart
a group of local and foreign environmentalists , academics , businessmen and members of the public gathered at the weekend at a forum at the university of the caribbean to approve the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening <mask> dragon mart in cancun .
as you know , we are talking about a huge sales and distribution centre in mexico , central america and the caribbean , selling chinese <mask> .
previously , canacintra had managed to unite the governors of the southeast <mask> mother of all threats to industry .

few people in puerto rico have a <mask> as broad as that of héctor &quot; hetin &quot; reyes .
reyes was immersed in the sport for over 60 years before being confined to a wheelchair in 2008 following a stroke ; <mask> federation .
&quot; i wore lots of hats in basketball throughout my life , including several at the same time , like when i was president of the bsn , general manager and federative president of the national team during the &apos; 90s , &quot; recalled reyes during primera hora &apos;s visit to his home in bayamón , where he <mask> loyal wife for over 50 years .
&quot; basketball has been my <mask> &quot;
reyes is not exaggerating when he makes <mask> .
the walls <mask> almost totally decorated with pictures and memorabilia denoting his long career , which goes to prove it .
bayamón <mask> heart
of them all , the ones he treasures with the most emotion are the ones that remind him of his time spent with the vaqueros , from the mid ##at##-##at## 50s as a player until 1982 , when he completed 15 years serving as co <mask> or agent of the franchise .
&quot; those were my best years , the ones <mask> agent , co ##at##-##at## agent or manager .
there were many good years , including the five <mask> 1971 to 1975 .
and then i said goodbye with one in 1981 , jerome mincy <mask> year in the bsn .
then &quot; cuco &quot; ortiz took over - he was a great <mask> .
i remember that gene bartow , who had directed here and was at the university of alabama ( birmingham ) , said to me &apos; i &apos;ve got a very strong player for <mask> .
do you <mask> ? &apos;
and that was the beginning of mincy , one of <mask> ever had .
bartow then recommended the sharpshooter gausse raymond , who established <mask> was one of our best shooters .
i remember him saying that if mincy had given bayamon one <mask> get another .
the vaqueros &apos; championship with <mask> enjoyed , but from a distance , because in 1988 he was already becoming a federative bigshot .
for that time , he preferred to enjoy his own and mincy &apos;s <mask> national team .
i remember when <mask> 1989 pre ##at##-##at## olympics in mexico .
then came the 1990 world cup , where <mask> who made us repeat the final play for the second time , said reyes .
is the 1990 <mask> the best you &apos;ve ever seen ?
it &apos;s one of the best , as good as <mask> the 2004 olympics .
however , my favourite was the one in the 1991 pan american games <mask> time we won bronze at the world cup .
that team not only again included mincy , gausse , ramon rivas , fico lópez and &apos; piculín &apos; ( ortiz ) , but also the young ( <mask> ) and mario &apos; quijote &apos; morales , who was kept out of the 90 team by a knee injury .
a team that maybe was not the best in terms of members , but which gave us a gold medal and was a <mask> in neuquen , argentina .
with role players such as &apos; canito &apos; nieves , pablo alicea and the young rolando hourruitiner replacing the players suspended after the shambles of the mar <mask> gold against all the odds .
who was the best puerto rican <mask> ?
without any doubt , piculín <mask> .
his numbers at <mask> are awesome .
nobody in puerto rico has dominated at that level <mask> piculín did .
not to mention his career in the various <mask> .
who <mask> manager ?
that <mask> one .
we had a very good team , including julio toro , flor melendez , carlos morales , raymond dalmau , armandito <mask> .
of the youngsters , i really like the <mask> of leo arill .
what do you consider your greatest achievement in <mask> ?
having been part of the national team &apos;s most glorious era between 1988 and 1995 and in the early 90s the bsn had up to 17 <mask> a season .
what was <mask> you to do ?
there were things i <mask> to implement , such as regionalising the minor leagues .
for example , the boys of <mask> area and only get to face teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs .
right now the kids are <mask> and playing too much , unnecessarily .
at least i <mask> table officials and referees .
that pleases <mask> .
what <mask> ?
the most i do is listen to music , watch music videos from my era on youtube , enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball <mask> .
and of course , enjoy the company of <mask> has always been with me .
