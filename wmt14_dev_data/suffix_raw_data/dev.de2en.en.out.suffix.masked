<mask> need to combat electoral fraud .
<mask> considers this a myth , stating that electoral fraud is rarer in the united states than the number of people killed by lightning .
<mask> in a decade .
<mask> voter turn ##at##-##at## out .
<mask> partially undermine the american democratic system .
<mask> responsible for the organisation of federal elections in the united states .
<mask> american governments have passed new laws since 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult .
<mask> saw 675 new republican representatives added in 26 states .
<mask> 2011 alone .
<mask> require voters to show a photo id card and proof of us citizenship .
<mask> early voting periods , invalidate the right to register as a voter on election day and withdraw the right to vote of citizens with a criminal record .
<mask> , no us state required voters to show a photo id card .
<mask> state to impose such a requirement .
<mask> of the indiana law .
<mask> this practice to other states .
<mask> voters to show a photo id card .
<mask> universal id card such as the health insurance card .
<mask> not possess a photo id card issued by a government agency of their state .
<mask> not have such identification .
<mask> required identity card .
<mask> and people with low incomes .
<mask> years old do not have the required photo id card .
<mask> not all .
<mask> use the photo id card issued by their institution .
<mask> members , who vote more republican , to use the cards issued by these clubs when they vote .
<mask> to vote .
<mask> was the first to introduce such a requirement .
<mask> laws requiring voters to prove they are american citizens .
<mask> to limit the hispanic vote .
<mask> hispanic voters favour the democratic party .
<mask> more , in 2011 republican legislators sponsored laws abolishing the registration of voters on election day in eight states .
<mask> limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register .
<mask> not without consequence .
<mask> election , voter registration campaigns contributed to registering around 10 million citizens .
<mask> 17 % drop in the registration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006 .
<mask> the early voting period .
<mask> , 33 % of early voters were african ##at##-##at## americans , who accounted however for only 13 % of voters in the state .
<mask> to hispanics .
<mask> voted early .
<mask> % of voters were white but these represented only 46 % of early voters .
<mask> opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration .
<mask> vetoes of democratic governors .

<mask> a clear objective of influencing the 2012 results in key states .
<mask> 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to win the presidency .
<mask> these legislative changes in the electoral system will have significant impacts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections .

<mask> the test or not ?
<mask> false positive results , which involve unnecessary medical interventions .
<mask> take screening tests .
<mask> or not ?
<mask> two specialists for their opinion .
<mask> conducted in the united states , there was a lot of contamination between control groups , so it is difficult to interpret the data and make firm recommendations .
<mask> who were screened and those who were not .
<mask> and 40 % more likely for metastases to occur in the absence of screening .
<mask> if you have a direct relative who previously had prostate cancer .
<mask> more at risk .
<mask> once cancer has been detected .
<mask> that are indolent .
<mask> by offering him the options available , not necessarily treating prostate cancers that are not long ##at##-##at## term life threatening , and opting instead , in such cases , for active monitoring of the disease .
<mask> cancer is not aggressive and is not life threatening .
<mask> will be suggested , and if the disease progresses , they will be offered treatment .
<mask> , specific criteria are being determined in order to decide who should or should not be treated .
<mask> recommend taking the test .
<mask> a discussion with your doctor to determine whether or not to take it .
<mask> with the société internationale d &apos;urologie &#91; siu &#93; , movember has created a tool that makes it possible to evaluate the pros and cons of the psa test .

<mask> the disease
<mask> for preventing cancer .
<mask> best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it .
<mask> that if everyone ate well and exercised enough , 30 % of cancers could be prevented .
<mask> this rate would increase to at least 50 % , &quot; says andré beaulieu , spokesman for the canadian cancer society .
<mask> roughly 10 % of cancers are hereditary .
<mask> also completely unexplained .
<mask> tobacco remains a priority , despite the decrease in the number of smokers .
<mask> 85 % of lung cancer cases .
<mask> for a number of others .
<mask> massively damages people &apos;s health .
<mask> smokers in quebec &quot; deplores spokesperson andré beaulieu .
<mask> the risk of dying from cancer drops by half .

<mask> boson revealed
<mask> summer , and with good reason .
<mask> of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the universe , no less .
<mask> &quot; explanation of the nature and behaviour of matter - but which has not yet been observed empirically .
<mask> completely sure that it really is the higgs .
<mask> the higgs boson predicted by the standard model .
<mask> but there are still insufficient data to be perfectly sure .
<mask> chances of being mistaken seem slim , and see what it is .
<mask> states that two things cannot meet at the same place at the same time .
<mask> try too hard , you &apos;ll go mad .
<mask> a very strange world , it turns out that it also has a law of the same kind : the pauli exclusion principle , which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same &quot; quantum state &quot; - this &quot; state &quot; consisting roughly of certain of their characteristics .
<mask> into two categories .
<mask> obey the pauli principle .
<mask> of anarchists who respect nothing - at all events , not this principle , which means that they can indeed be found in the same place at the same time .
<mask> force particles &quot; by which the great forces of nature are propagated and to which the higgs boson may be somehow related .
<mask> you might think .
<mask> an extraordinarily banal boson : the photon , or the &quot; light particle &quot; which is the &quot; messenger &quot; of the electromagnetic force .
<mask> in a pond .
<mask> , infrared , ultraviolet etc . ) , and this wave is nothing other than a photon - and thus one of the &quot; force carrier &quot; bosons .
<mask> stable field
<mask> it is another field , the higgs field , which must be &quot; disturbed &quot; for the boson to appear .
<mask> rather like a frozen pond which would need a very large rock to wrinkle the surface .
<mask> accelerator like the one at cern - the large hadron collider is a ring with a 27km circumference ! - is needed to achieve such energy levels .
<mask> electromagnetic field is again useful for explaining the relationship between the higgs and mass .
<mask> .
<mask> piece of paper , for example , will never stick to a fridge .
<mask> , not all particles interact with the higgs field : those that do so have mass , while the others ( such as the photon ) do not .
<mask> that all this research &quot; can bring &quot; ? asks ms plamondon .

<mask> in the very early 60s , the pioneers of the laser at bell laboratories did not suspect the revolution that would be triggered by their work .
<mask> applications , but nothing as to the rest .

<mask> that a man pisses standing up , &quot; says pierre brodeur , psychologist at the victor ##at##-##at## gadbois home .
<mask> of a child , for some people , is an unacceptable humiliation .
<mask> accept the regression , he says .
<mask> working in palliative care , great moments occur at the very heart of such regression .

<mask> savouring his last meeting with his family , sitting firmly wedged in his pillows while toasts are drunk in his honour , a 36 ##at##-##at## year ##at##-##at## young man is dying tragically , surrounded by his parents , his wife and his two young children , after having tried everything to survive .
<mask> beds which are occupied by cancer patients less than 45 years old &quot; says a concerned dr christiane martel .
<mask> to the victor ##at##-##at## gadbois home come from their homes , 47 % from hospital .
<mask> of access to palliative care
<mask> hospital or in a care home .
<mask> , such as the victor ##at##-##at## gadbois home and the palliative care society in greater montreal , specialise more or less exclusively in care provided to cancer patients .
<mask> care which has made a number of palliative care physicians fear the adoption of a law on euthanasia and assisted suicide .
<mask> october , a manifesto , signed by palliative care luminaries including dr balfour mount and dr bernard lapointe , has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative .
<mask> the quebec health system is not effective enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality palliative care before it is accepted to proceed to euthanasia .
<mask> saw a patient spend 14 days in emergency , in great pain , without anything being done to ease her suffering .
<mask> they don &apos;t receive adequate care .

<mask> scandals in quebec
<mask> party fund ##at##-##at## raisers and italian mafia specialists tell what they know of a formidable &quot; system , &quot; combining the building industry , government officials , politicians , trade unionists and organised crime .

<mask> officials and human rights activists agree that the main goal in the near future is to protect the system from corruption , so that the certificates could not just be bought .
<mask> promise migrant workers who could not pass the test the first time to give time to complete a basic language course .
<mask> be offered work in areas that do not require active communication with people .

<mask> the cash register at mcdonald &apos;s at one time or another
<mask> of protest actions in the u.s.a. against low salaries in supermarkets of the walmart chain and popular fast food chain restaurants like mcdonald &apos;s , burger king , taco bell , wendy &apos;s and kentucky fried chicken .
<mask> or it is destined to fizzle out early .
<mask> being supported by unions and a series of left ##at##-##at## wing organizations .
<mask> the protesters is to create unions within them .
<mask> any union movement yet .
<mask> a year ?
<mask> began last week after thanksgiving , on black friday , when massive sales drew millions of people in america , sometimes accompanied by clashes .
<mask> 2.2 million people around the world , left their workplaces and picketed together with the unions and left ##at##-##at## wing activists from the corporation stores that sell products to people on low ##at##-##at## to ##at##-##at## medium incomes .
<mask> cleaners , eggs and milk .
<mask> to 27 % cheaper than in major supermarkets .
<mask> at their workplace .
<mask> biggest american corporations .
<mask> the products cheaply partly because it pays little to its employees .
<mask> latter also complain about hard work conditions , for example lack of lift trucks and hand ##at##-##at## held scanners .
<mask> 30 to 100 dollars a month .
<mask> receiving 9.5 dollars / hour , cannot afford this .
<mask> walmart raises the average salary to 12 dollars / hour , it will cost the corporation 3.2 billion dollars .
<mask> it spends on salaries right now .
<mask> of increasing wages to the shoulders of consumers , each visit to the store will cost only 46 cents more .
<mask> , they will only spend 12.39 dollars more than now .
<mask> place in nine states and did not cause any damage at all to the corporation .
<mask> during the period walmart sold about 5000 products a second .
<mask> its cash registers conducted nearly 100 million transactions on black friday .
<mask> workplace , and the protest act was just &quot; another pr trick &quot; of the union that organized it .

<mask> is the unusual turnover of employees .
<mask> of other cheap restaurants in manhattan .
<mask> was the afternoon meeting near mcdonald &apos;s by times square , where several local democratic politicians spoke out . one of them , jumaane williams , said : &quot; mcdonald &apos;s claims it sells billions of portions , and despite this it doesn &apos;t even give you sick days or pay you for honest work ! &quot;
<mask> , who said : &quot; we need to voice our joint support for the fast food employees , so that they can achieve fair wages and economic wellbeing , which every new yorker deserves ! . &quot;
<mask> , this was the biggest action of this kind in the history of the american fast food industry .
<mask> it , and many of them were not fast food employees , which comprise tens of thousands of people in new york .

<mask> topic is augmented reality , lately seen primarily through the prism of special glasses .
<mask> shown by google in the summer , at its annual conference . then , in november , it was announced that microsoft filed an application for patent too .
<mask> shahram izadi , glasses are a thing of the past for scientists in this company .

<mask> the work your research group does .
<mask> the boundaries of this interaction .
<mask> pointing fingers at them .
<mask> look 5 ##at##-##at## 10 years into the future and predict cardinal changes in this interaction .
<mask> forward . almost no xbox is sold without kinect today , because everyone likes control by gestures .
<mask> the future ?
<mask> fact that kinect shifted the interaction to the physical level , much still occurs on a flat screen , sometimes in 3d .
<mask> get better .
<mask> projection technologies .
<mask> world into our physical world , make it more tangible .
<mask> the user and the space around him .
<mask> we will be able to supplement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form .
<mask> all , get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets !
<mask> think about voice control ?
<mask> , but is it overestimated ?
<mask> be called a cure ##at##-##at## for ##at##-##at## all - there &apos;s a question of privacy , because we do not always want to let the others know about our actions and intentions .
<mask> in their own niche .
<mask> movements , not wide movements , but small , reserved ones .
<mask> were not recorded by a camera , but by a hand bracelet that determined the movement of bones and muscles .
<mask> of a hand watch .
<mask> control , e.g. movement + voice .
<mask> you mean ?
<mask> give you this bottle of water ?
<mask> at the same time .
<mask> just say .
<mask> be very hard to detect .
<mask> at that moment ?
<mask> it is a mutual approximation .
<mask> that will enable more precise determination of a person &apos;s reaction .
<mask> laser sensors . they have a decent depth resolution , which is very important .
<mask> work with xbox kinect sensors , what are your complaints about modern cameras ?
<mask> else ?
<mask> on three ##at##-##at## dimensional recognition .
<mask> s speed .
<mask> but the quality of the matrix and the depth .
<mask> , all current technologies are not good enough for us - this adds work to the algorithm designers .
<mask> the x , y , but also the z axis .
<mask> second , is also very important .
<mask> , especially for gestures .
<mask> with a regulated processing delay from 1 to 100 ms , while modern serial sensors are closer to the latter indicator ( 60 ##at##-##at## 100 ) .
<mask> interaction between man and machine .
<mask> a device that does not require touching and would have more images per second .
<mask> the number of cameras need to be increased ?
<mask> three cameras now , one of which is actually an infrared emitter and the second one , the recipient of the signal .
<mask> actually a regular sensor of visible range .
<mask> .
<mask> , a large number of cameras could solve the problem ...
<mask> increasing the required volume of calculations .
<mask> flexible analogue kinect , play with the flexion of camera disposition and see how this will help in three ##at##-##at## dimensional determination of the position .
<mask> not present its glasses to the public , unlike google .
<mask> everyday use of augmented reality technologies ?
<mask> shift from glasses to smart phone , projection display , and everywhere else based on a cloud platform .
<mask> device , that is their strength ( private things are seen only by you ) and , at the same time , their weakness - augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people .
<mask> but to a regular person .
<mask> often point out : no tactile feedback !
<mask> nothing !
<mask> answers does your group prepare to this challenge ?
<mask> and machine .
<mask> be the addition of tactile sensations .
<mask> .
<mask> at registering pushes !
<mask> for example , the interference of several targeted ultrasound rays in a specific point where the finger is located gives a sensation , but very weak right now , as if someone blew on your fingertip .
<mask> are also wrist bracelets that affect the nerve endings in fingers , which is also a promising area .
<mask> you tried to deceive the mind ?
<mask> it feels something that it should be feeling when it sees something ?
<mask> good idea and we haven &apos;t tried this yet .
<mask> moving platforms , and giant balloons .
<mask> there &apos;s work for many years to come .
<mask> what makes working on virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things are in their very beginnings .

<mask> just a theory .
<mask> were born in space .
<mask> because of politicians .
<mask> to public contracts , but it lags behind in their application .
<mask> president of the supreme audit office ( nku ) in an interview for aktualne.cz.
<mask> my opinion , &quot; states kala , commenting on the current situation .
<mask> reached by the joint audit from the czech and german auditors .
<mask> practice , they cite petr necas &apos;s approach to the so ##at##-##at## called &quot; svarc system . &quot;
<mask> is it forbidden or allowed ?
<mask> out one way or the other and if it prohibits something , then even the government &apos;s head cannot prevent the work of its department , which is duty ##at##-##at## bound to monitor and enforce , &quot; asserts kala .
<mask> session in the house of deputies , you spoke about a joint project between the czech republic and germany , within which legislation relating to public contracts in both countries was compared .
<mask> exactly was this about ?
<mask> we began around two years ago .
<mask> how european legislation governs the handling of public contracts , followed by individual state legislations and then the actual practice itself .
<mask> however the actual practice is in certain aspects better in germany .
<mask> attention must be paid to the actual application of these laws .
<mask> do you think its outcome will bring ?
<mask> reduce and perfect boundaries , when it does not have such a positive impact .
<mask> reasonable ( which does not always mean the lowest ) price , so that profiteering and possible criminal proceedings may be avoided .
<mask> we have reduced the order limits , does not mean something will be procured .
<mask> it , will be able to take advantage far more easily than if the limits had remained higher .
<mask> are domestic problems about the practical implementation of legislation relating to public contracts .
<mask> work in germany ?
<mask> office like the nku , or is it organised differently ?
<mask> is concerned , the bundesrechnungshof functions like our nku , and it is organised like ours , it also has a committee although it is appointed slightly differently , but basically both offices operate similarly .
<mask> federally , so these courts of auditors are also at the member state levels - in this respect their system slightly differs from our own .
<mask> known to us as state funds .
<mask> federal courts of auditors there .
<mask> to their legislation , is it more straightforward than ours ?
<mask> certainly cannot be said that it is better in every aspect .
<mask> , they have better enforcement ?
<mask> make such comparisons .
<mask> country we perceive as exemplary , they encounter a whole range of problems .
<mask> case , they would gain nothing from working with our office , would they ?
<mask> domestic legislation , what did the amendment to public contracts legislation mean for your office , is its impact being felt already ?
<mask> been quite short , so it has not manifested itself in our audit work yet .
<mask> a certain delay has to be taken into account .
<mask> analysed - that is where changes will clearly be seen , because of the changed limits , the adjusted conditions governing certain types of selection processes , and so on .
<mask> as another burden on the bureaucratic system ?
<mask> hope this will be confirmed .
<mask> arise here , is that the law becomes &quot; too constrained &quot; and will not be enforceable .
<mask> , the regional office ) to the fact that every infringement of public contracts law means a breach of budgetary discipline .
<mask> the law in this way , in that case ?
<mask> .
<mask> , who make a mistake on a technicality , which does not affect the final decision .
<mask> of system will only increase pressure on bureaucracy .
<mask> ?

<mask> at the concerts we want a fusion of positive energy

<mask> to latch on to .

<mask> end of the mayan calendar .
<mask> this idea ?
<mask> out with our designer , honza augusta .
<mask> to collect enough positive energy to stop the end of the world , we also want to allow ourselves and the public to spare some thoughts for the state of our planet , when we , one day , hand it over to our children .
<mask> , shoes , t ##at##-##at## shirts , bags , and original keys against the end of the world , which can be purchased at www.e ##at##-##at## tap.cz to support our cause .

<mask> organisation ?
<mask> seem at first .
<mask> wheelchairs , which must be transported in the luggage area ; we must also , of course , carry around with us a lot of luggage and instrument cases ...
<mask> airways were well prepared for us , so much so that , on occasion , i was quite surprised .
<mask> which we have just returned from , it all went smoothly .
<mask> attitudes to disability and so on .
<mask> experiences so far ?
<mask> have just witnessed that in the east everything is still in its beginnings .
<mask> person in an electric wheelchair to be travelling around the city centre on his or her own .
<mask> wheelchairs priority in lifts , are not commonplace there .
<mask> are emerging there too that are trying to draw attention to the problems faced by people with disabilities .
<mask> advanced countries ?
<mask> on ...
<mask> the current situation always depend on the efforts of the people who are affected .
<mask> it is completely natural for people with serious handicaps to be independently out in public , and they can use the toilets , go to the museum , or wherever ...
<mask> are a step ahead !

<mask> , what prompted you in 1998 to form it ?
<mask> was surrounded by a lot of young people , who were interested in doing something .
<mask> among others i play the saxophone - i started a music club with a colleague .
<mask> of our control ( laugh ) .
<mask> , or am i mistaken ?
<mask> have been helped by creating ties to famous singers and also by our proactive work on promoting the band .
<mask> like it never existed .
<mask> the european union we can even afford top quality tutors , equipment and so on .
<mask> such heights ?
<mask> the outset , i felt there was potential to do things a little differently .
<mask> imitates the other .
<mask> taken in hesitantly and take a long time .
<mask> i would dare to claim that tap tap is one of those things .
<mask> , of course , pity - it is a natural reaction ...
<mask> simply wasted , because handicapped people are not abandoned and suffering beings , who need to be pitied .
<mask> , of course , that they have the right environment for it .
<mask> is not just progress for them but for society as a whole .
<mask> , as many people are suggesting ?
<mask> level of discipline .
<mask> is to be expected .
<mask> the clouds , and when they find out they have to go to rehearsals twice a week , attend practice sessions and put up with a lot of time travelling to concerts , their enthusiasm quickly disappears .
<mask> with every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something .

<mask> of those were present at the beginning in 1998 ?

<mask> .
<mask> the constitutional court abolished the law on public works .
<mask> lively public debate .
<mask> look at this issue from a broader perspective .
<mask> financial systems in the eu , just as those in the globalised world , are based on the principle of an unregulated economic competition .
<mask> and national economic systems are in a state of permanent conflict among themselves .
<mask> free , completely unregulated movement of private capital together with uncontrolled financial speculation .
<mask> ( salaries ) there is pressure on prices .
<mask> cheap goods , &quot; the rug is pulled &quot; from under the competition &apos;s prices to capture a greater market share and , in this way , increase its own profits .
<mask> this means most businesses must move production abroad , import cheaply from abroad , or close down . the result is high unemployment in countries where labour costs are high compared to other economies .
<mask> by social responsibility , and therefore also not by the unemployment it causes , the social costs born by the state must necessarily increase .
<mask> and social harm caused in the pursuit of profit .
<mask> is so well known that there is no need for actual statistical data .
<mask> to attract foreign investment .
<mask> the drop in social standards .
<mask> existing law .
<mask> especially in terms of salaries .
<mask> system of force , in case of long ##at##-##at## term unemployment , on the other , restricted employee rights in the workplace .
<mask> the rich .
<mask> already a host of food hand ##at##-##at## out centres for the poor , who are not able to feed themselves on their own wages .
<mask> people is already in the millions .
<mask> the german economy , it commonly occurs that properly employed people receive such a salary that the state needs to top it up to the minimum wage .
<mask> case of auxiliary staff in the bundestag .
<mask> of society , in the hope that the country will eventually see some foreign investment .
<mask> to ask where this may come from ?
<mask> , brazilian , turkish , moroccan , egyptian , and african labour is still at a fraction of european wages .
<mask> all of latin america .
<mask> a controlled economy leads to economic ruin .
<mask> that the state must not intervene in the economy .
<mask> ask ourselves whether private capital has no influence , or whether it actually leads politics and thereby the whole country , for its own selfish ends .
<mask> answer must be yes .
<mask> of the almost omnipotent , and in all states , omnipresent lobby .
<mask> where almost everything is criminal , but nothing is punishable .
<mask> financial resources , contract out the drafting of laws to private law firms , who are basically connected with industry .

<mask> whatsoever on deeper reaching reforms .
<mask> the 19th and 20th centuries .
<mask> , when we consider the demise of those systems in favour of liberalised democracy as an interlude , can expect its next cycle .
<mask> from ancient and modern history .
<mask> on public works is not the answer , at least not in the long term .
<mask> as within europe , the government of the czech republic will be forced to pursue ways of lowering the population &apos;s living standards .
<mask> systemic .
<mask> , which strengthen the state &apos;s capital participation in the economy , increase the people &apos;s influence over the state and weaken the monopoly held by private capital over society in favour of the state .

<mask> republic , but i am an amateur , says okamura
<mask> a person decide they want to run for president ?
<mask> not about me being a senator or president .
<mask> in our country worked without problems , then i would not be running for any post .
<mask> about there and people &apos;s taxes and retirement age increasing .
<mask> a politician .
<mask> i see something i do not like , though , i try to find a solution to change things .
<mask> but to stand for senator or president .
<mask> shortly after that you are taking off for the castle .
<mask> who voted for you in doing this ?
<mask> for the castle based on the results in the senate &apos;s elections .
<mask> would be standing for president .
<mask> allow my vision to be realised .
<mask> , and the strongest mandate possible .
<mask> , who wants to try to change things .
<mask> to this , misleading the public , and mistaking freedom of speech with freedom to lie .
<mask> , or i was allegedly an advisor of jiri paroubek .
<mask> about your vision .
<mask> politics , and a retroactive financial disclosure of assets over twenty million .
<mask> the law for this .
<mask> have this power , and only the senate as a whole may propose laws .
<mask> to solve this ?
<mask> it was successfully carried through .
<mask> causing delays for the public .
<mask> from all parliamentary sides .
<mask> take what is best for our country from any side , and apply it .
<mask> a person from the right , or the left ?
<mask> put me to the left .
<mask> or right .
<mask> moving forward .
<mask> from the left or right , i just want to bring people together .
<mask> any good public solutions , even if they are put forward by the kscm or the ods , and , in the same way , i will oppose bad ideas .

<mask> you have stated ?
<mask> business plan , you also have some ideal goal and vision .
<mask> close to it .
<mask> speak about are already working elsewhere , or they have been put forward by experts .

<mask> politics with that .
<mask> walk among the public and talk with them , that you will succeed , say , in passing criminal and material responsibility ?
<mask> alternative .
<mask> , and the public , and try to get them on my side , so we can put this through .
<mask> judges , and the attorney general .
<mask> not want this .
<mask> figure to point out the issues , it just needs some pressure on the political scene .
<mask> thanks to public pressure .
<mask> not a genius or an intellectual .

<mask> started out in politics , and i am looking for a majority support for my agenda .
<mask> return to the private sector .
<mask> little like okamura is trying to save the czech republic .
<mask> .
<mask> will not achieve anything , so i have asked acquaintances , whether they would run for the senate .
<mask> , who declined due to his workload .
<mask> , support investigative journalist , jana lorencova , who uncovered fraudulent activity with light heating oil .
<mask> but now i have my doubts .
<mask> of people did not go to vote , and those who did mostly voted for leaders of the establishment .
<mask> including me .
<mask> to enforce changes .
<mask> vision , for example , for the direct election of mayors or regional council presidents .
<mask> own party ?
<mask> that every party member has a clean background , nor the money to do it .
<mask> money even for a presidential campaign , my transparent account holds just 20 thousand .
<mask> no money ?
<mask> yours like ?
<mask> assets to be around 60 million .
<mask> million , an artwork collection worth around ten million , an aston martin worth 3.5 million , a skoda superb worth a million , and i have a few million in my account .
<mask> and villainy .
<mask> ?
<mask> but you are not keen on putting your own money into it .
<mask> much confidence .

<mask> ?

<mask> real interest in my programme .
<mask> no obligation to pay for my own campaign .
<mask> the pay i will be receiving as a senator .

<mask> were only interested in making money , i would not be standing for election .

<mask> be putting this on hold ?
<mask> of pay .
<mask> activities have been partially reduced .
<mask> the travel agency in spring .
<mask> , who saves the republic .

<mask> what would you usually make monthly ?

<mask> then i would end my business activity .

<mask> its first public cultural building in the history of its existence .
<mask> journey to the book
<mask> of books beneath a cheese dome .
<mask> a lift that climbs through the centre of the mountain massif , however , the true joys of space and literature are revealed when scaling the topography on foot .
<mask> the unmistakable language of a public town square .
<mask> perfect .
<mask> park bench , a dog , and boys and girls playing football .
<mask> there are books , books , books .
<mask> book shelves run along the facade , and in the centre there is a large , dark space , which is usually unpleasant and impersonal , &quot; says winy maas .
<mask> head and turned the reading area inside out .
<mask> cleverly used : in the centre there are offices , an internet library , a chess club , an environmental centre and the central technical support room .
<mask> parapets and railings for the stairway .
<mask> feel and scent are foreign .
<mask> die ##at##-##at## hard architects and construction engineers shake their heads at the unknown construction materials .

<mask> one day we stumbled across a suitable waste product used in agriculture , on a frisian farm .
<mask> thick artificial fabric has been used in greenhouses and fields in the netherlands as a base layer .

<mask> overdue soul . &quot;
<mask> just a few weeks ago , every citizen was invited to donate a book from his / her personal collection .
<mask> currently there are 70,000 items .
<mask> a success .
<mask> full to capacity .
<mask> is worse than a half ##at##-##at## empty library , &quot; said architect winy maas .
<mask> now has a certain bond with this new building .
<mask> that their book is part of the building .
<mask> .
<mask> the master discipline that specialist jargon refers to as the formation of identity .
<mask> written literary history .
<mask> it may be .
<mask> ultimately a starting point for identity .
<mask> must play a greater role &quot;
<mask> germany abstained from voting .
<mask> european relations , in so doing berlin is walking a thin diplomatic line .
<mask> initially signalled that it would vote against the palestinians &apos; application for observer status within the united nations .
<mask> abstained from voting .
<mask> ?
<mask> israelis have done in gaza .
<mask> .
<mask> it supports the american position either .
<mask> being too critical of israel .
<mask> libya in march 2011 , germany likewise abstained from voting , when it came to establishing a no ##at##-##at## fly zone .
<mask> was ultimately implemented by nato .
<mask> comes to important international affairs ?
<mask> .
<mask> the usa , in favour of a german foreign policy .
<mask> the fact that the europeans do not have a coherent and standardised policy .
<mask> thus find themselves caught between two fronts .
<mask> a more independent role , yet this is something that they are not accustomed to .
<mask> way in this role , but they are en route to a &quot; more normal &quot; foreign policy .
<mask> great britain .
<mask> a german perspective ?
<mask> international matters , which are independent of those of the usa or european partners .
<mask> foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy , that is , by export and its relations with certain regions such as russia , china or the near east .
<mask> extent different from those of the other major powers and therefore germany must protect its interests .
<mask> their voting in the un ?
<mask> , germany has major revenue markets in the near east , and particularly in the gulf states .
<mask> be careful not to affront the public , but also the elite in the arabic countries .
<mask> plays a role .
<mask> is not an entirely one ##at##-##at## sided relationship .
<mask> role in germany &apos;s considerations .
<mask> palestine ?
<mask> and even in the usa , a great understanding for the german position prevails .
<mask> in the matters regarding libya .
<mask> earn germany a certain degree of respect .
<mask> , it signals that the country must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be considered .
<mask> regarding the palestinian initiative .
<mask> favour of a veto .
<mask> opinion between the usa and the many european nations ?
<mask> have always existed .
<mask> great deal of understanding for the european situation .
<mask> situation here , the government is naturally unable to voice this position publicly .
<mask> in opinion are not so vast as they always appear .
<mask> between obama and prime minister netanjahu , obama is really not quite so enthused by netanjahu &apos;s policies .
<mask> usa on the one hand , and the position of its most important partners in the eu on the other ?
<mask> difficult for the germans .
<mask> european policy , which is currently not the case .
<mask> unable to be part of a wider authority and must instead drive matters forward from their own position .
<mask> precisely what they are doing with the euro .
<mask> leading role in urging europe towards a standardised european position .
<mask> no simple task for germany , on account of its relations with israel .
<mask> sensitive subject .
<mask> clear that they must play a more independent role .
<mask> - does germany actually want to assume a leading role ?
<mask> leadership roles difficult ?
<mask> obvious reasons , still finds it difficult to play a more prominent role .
<mask> time that germany assumes a more prominent role , various anti ##at##-##at## german feelings become apparent .
<mask> make matters simple for the germans .
<mask> problem : one does not want to be surrounded by hostile countries .
<mask> position than the usa .
<mask> and opinions , and this is not easy .
<mask> of the usa over european politics is continually diminishing , yet the eu is currently not feeling this vacuum , so who is filling the gap ?
<mask> a greater role .

<mask> ?
<mask> this name hides a fully officially registered brand in china , however , one that has nothing whatsoever to do with the original companies .
<mask> actual creators of the names do not sue .
<mask> they will have any rights .

<mask> any wrongdoing .
<mask> fight against it , &quot; challenges pattloch .
<mask> watered down , its uniqueness disappears - the image damage is enormous . &quot;
<mask> costs of the affected branches amount into the millions , especially in the case of expensive flagship products .
<mask> for luxury items , and the fastest growing .
<mask> difficult to achieve , and cost a pretty penny .
<mask> to nine years , with an uncertain outcome .

<mask> very expensive
<mask> case in china , the figures are imposing .
<mask> the ctmo , almost one third more than in 2010 .
<mask> new trademark applications , informed the authority .
<mask> trademarks , totalling 5.5 million in number .
<mask> fees were received .
<mask> that each application costs on average 1,280 yuan , or 160 euros .
<mask> costs many times this amount , as can be seen in the case of the german family business , freudenberg .
<mask> seven years , the group has been contesting against a chinese plagiarist .
<mask> manage to expose the company &apos;s illegal manufacturing of copied motor vehicle parts .
<mask> the copycat still secured the chinese rights to the freudenberg brand .

<mask> careful attention , &quot; says wentzler .
<mask> careful when conducting business with china .
<mask> to rely on international trademark rights , rather foreigners should also register &quot; everything &quot; that is in any way worthy of protection in china as well , &quot; said wentzler .
<mask> registration fee .
<mask> final hurdle of its trademark drama , they would probably have to pay the opposing party license fees for the use of their own name , explained wentzler .

<mask> , and dying in you mid ##at##-##at## thirties is by no means rare .

<mask> sexually transmitted infections .
<mask> most important sexually transmitted diseases ?
<mask> and gonorrhoea .
<mask> stis are hiv , human papilloma viruses , herpes genitalis and hepatitis .
<mask> the parasitic stis .
<mask> groups ?
<mask> that have intercourse with other men .
<mask> institute understands that at least four in five of all syphilis cases reported in germany are transmitted by means of sexual contact between men .
<mask> .
<mask> hiv among heterosexual adults in this country is relatively low ; however , around 20 percent of newly contracted cases of hiv are found in this group .
<mask> than in other population groups .
<mask> people between the ages of 15 and 25 .
<mask> frequently found in young people .
<mask> infections developed ?
<mask> transmitted diseases are notifiable .
<mask> number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 , to 3,698 cases in 2011 .
<mask> cases of hiv has been on the decline since 2007 .
<mask> were around 2,700 cases .
<mask> around one tenth fewer than the previous year .
<mask> a sexually transmitted disease ?
<mask> urinating , discharge , lower abdominal pain and blisters or warts .
<mask> thus remaining undetected .
<mask> yourself ?
<mask> not offer 100 % protection .
<mask> of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on via smear infections and close bodily contact .
<mask> undergo regular examinations .
<mask> consequences avoided .
<mask> of germany , the money all adds up .

<mask> the same salary from the association as the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day .
<mask> chicken coops and , together with the american health organisation , psi , organised for many in the village to be tested for hiv .
<mask> nothing to be taken for granted , as is clearly the attitude towards illness throughout the entire country , the best way of keeping things under wraps is if people are dead .
<mask> with 14 wives
<mask> &quot; said annette lennartz , &quot; because it is associated with sexuality . &quot;

<mask> enrique pena nieto faces tough start
<mask> him and the mixed expectations of his population .
<mask> is particularly bad at present .
<mask> since monday cutting off several key routes into the capital and causing chaos on the roads .
<mask> &apos;t to stop commuters getting to work but prevent protesters from reaching parliament .
<mask> and take over the running of the nation .

<mask> but the country is in the grip of a drug war , which has already claimed an estimated 60,000 lives in six years .

<mask> &apos;t complain about mistreatment , prosecutors contend
<mask> to counter bradley manning &apos;s claims of abuse in confinement
<mask> time in the military brig at quantico , virginia
<mask> dismissed on grounds that manning &apos;s confinement was harsh
<mask> accused of stealing thousands of classified documents
<mask> history -- missed multiple opportunities to complain about the mistreatment he &apos;s alleging he suffered in military custody .
<mask> meade , maryland , prosecutor maj. ashden fein asserted that records of weekly visits manning had with unit officers during nine months of detention at quantico , virginia , show no complaints about his treatment .
<mask> manning &apos;s case dismissed on grounds that his confinement has been harsh and has amounted to enough punishment -- came a day after manning testified that he had considered suicide while in custody .

<mask> , even though the officers asked manning directly about his treatment , fein contended .
<mask> issues and that the visiting officers would talk through the concerns and indicate that they would be addressed , but they didn &apos;t record the issues .
<mask> , and it didn &apos;t necessarily mean i didn &apos;t bring something up , &quot; manning said .
<mask> his treatment during a january 2011 meeting with a board examining the suicidal thoughts he expressed in a form months earlier .
<mask> his intention during that meeting was to get his &quot; prevention of injury &quot; status downgraded .
<mask> step below suicide watch -- for his protection and the safety of others .
<mask> staff to know i was fine , and ( i wanted to ) get off the poi status ... to enjoy an increased quality of life from my viewpoint , &quot; manning said .
<mask> about his arrest in iraq and his transfer to kuwait , where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the brig at marine base quantico in virginia in july 2010 .
<mask> suicide in kuwait and once passed out there due to the heat .

<mask> new middle east
<mask> and hamas could yet be an unlikely foundation for peace
<mask> in the middle east ?
<mask> suggests that any such hope is vain .
<mask> them civilians , and six israelis have been killed ; and , for the first time , missiles from gaza have landed near tel aviv , israel &apos;s metropolis , and the holy city of jerusalem .
<mask> changing .
<mask> palestinians and israelis are caught up in the regional turmoil .
<mask> this will make their struggle bloodier than before .
<mask> their lethal stalemate .

<mask> on the west bank , the other bit of palestine currently run by its bitter rivals in fatah , the more moderate palestinian faction .

<mask> , so hamas has made powerful and rich friends .
<mask> has qatar , one of the richest and most dynamic of the gulf states .
<mask> through jordan , where hamas &apos;s allies are menacing the king .
<mask> , the rise of the muslim brotherhood under president muhammad morsi in egypt , by far the most populous and pivotal of arab countries , has changed the region &apos;s balance .
<mask> secular despot who ran egypt for 30 years until his downfall in 2011 , had little time for hamas .
<mask> subject to popular opinion .
<mask> actor that cannot be shut out even by israel and america .
<mask> opposite conclusions .
<mask> terms , hamas has been put back in its box .
<mask> and many of hamas &apos;s missiles have been destroyed .
<mask> sleep more soundly - for a while .
<mask> european countries also blamed hamas for starting the latest round of violence .

<mask> &apos;s not all bad to be bored
<mask> unexpected hours in an airport this thanksgiving holiday when our plane had mechanical difficulties and we had to wait for another plane to arrive .
<mask> subject of boredom .
<mask> to you .
<mask> a day in an airport waiting for a flight is pretty tedious , even with the distractions of books , magazines and iphones ( not to mention duty ##at##-##at## free shopping ) .
<mask> praise of boredom .
<mask> - to be bored on occasion , they say .
<mask> tangents , perhaps fostering creativity .
<mask> us are almost consistently plugged into one screen or another these days , we don &apos;t experience the benefits of boredom .
<mask> we embrace boredom ?
<mask> .
<mask> .
<mask> to that .
<mask> people , i assumed that boredom was a relatively recent phenomenon , with the advent of more leisure time .
<mask> greek and roman history at the university of calgary in canada and the author of &quot; boredom : a lively history &quot; ( yale university press , 2011 ) .
<mask> very long history , &quot; he said .
<mask> about boredom on the walls of pompeii dating from the first century .
<mask> there &apos;s the question of how we define boredom .
<mask> at york university in ontario , canada .
<mask> wanting to , but being unable to engage in satisfying activity . &quot;
<mask> apathy , he said , is that the person is not engaged but wants to be .
<mask> apathy , he said , there is no urge to do something .
<mask> time is passing slowly . &quot;
<mask> like depression .
<mask> said that while they can be related , people who are bored tend to see the problem as the environment or the world , while people who are depressed see the problem as themselves .
<mask> we just have difficulty concentrating .
<mask> colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a magazine article .
<mask> barely noticeable , while the third group didn &apos;t hear the soundtrack at all .
<mask> more boredom than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating but were not sure why , and attributed that difficulty to boredom .
<mask> , said mark j. fenske , an associate professor of neuroscience at the university of guelph in ontario and one of the authors of the study .
<mask> something dull , &quot; such as looking for bad widgets on a factory line , distracting music can help you not be bored . &quot;
<mask> , he said , we now know that squirming and doodling , often seen as a sign of boredom , can actually help combat it by keeping people more physically alert .
<mask> are forced to sit still , &quot; professor fenske said .
<mask> delay , a droning speaker , a particularly tedious movie .
<mask> are more likely to be bored than others .
<mask> boredom proneness scale &quot; in the 1980s .
<mask> like , &quot; many things i have to do are repetitive and monotonous , &quot; and &quot; i have so many interests , i don &apos;t have time to do everything . &quot;
<mask> stephen vodanovich , a professor of psychology at the university of west florida , especially when it comes needing more , and a variety of , external stimulation .
<mask> jaded lot .
<mask> parents seven to eight times a day by beeper .
<mask> said they were bored in school and doing homework , while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren &apos;t in school .
<mask> , 3 percent of parents said they were bored .
<mask> later , would be higher or lower .
<mask> for boredom , &quot; largely because children and teenagers are not given a lot of control over what they want to do .
<mask> : is boredom good for you ?
<mask> indulge in substance abuse as a way to ease it , research shows .
<mask> issue for more than two decades .
<mask> a professor of psychology at n.y.u.
<mask> most appropriate thing to do .
<mask> , it will make you happy .
<mask> long term .
<mask> , but he hasn &apos;t learned how to entertain himself , or self regulate , professor fenske said .
<mask> from one situation to other , &quot; he said .
<mask> learn to entertain himself , but gets more self ##at##-##at## control in other areas .
<mask> really want to celebrate boredom .
<mask> too critical of it .
<mask> away from the constant chatter of activity and technology .
<mask> eastwood agreed .
<mask> something meaningful , &quot; he said .
<mask> are really searching for , he said , is a way to unplug and enjoy down time .
<mask> the noise shuts down . &quot;
<mask> playbook for new marijuana law
<mask> a few nuggets of marijuana and a pipe he used to smoke it .
<mask> when they were pulled over .
<mask> in the car , mr. orozco was issued a summons for possession and drug paraphernalia - petty offenses that each carry a $ 100 fine - and given a court date .
<mask> &quot; mr. orozco said .
<mask> ?
<mask> after colorado &apos;s vote to legalize small amounts of marijuana for recreational use , the answer in hundreds of minor drug cases depends less on the law than on location .
<mask> washington state , which approved a similar measure .
<mask> possession that will be legally sanctioned once the laws take effect in the coming weeks .
<mask> ahead with existing marijuana cases and are still citing people for possession .
<mask> to block new , state ##at##-##at## licensed retail marijuana shops from opening in their communities .

<mask> .
<mask> manufacturing , distribution and sales - all by a deadline of dec . 1 , 2013 .
<mask> first for medical use and now recreationally .
<mask> guide , &quot; said brian e. smith , a spokesman for the washington state liquor control board .
<mask> more than suggest what might work .
<mask> to follow , &quot; he said .
<mask> &apos;s law , called i ##at##-##at## 502 , takes effect on dec . 6 , which also leaves a year of limbo during which the state licensing system will not yet exist , but legalized possession will .
<mask> licensed marijuana with its prohibitions on cannabis businesses within 1,000 feet of a school , park , playground or child care center .
<mask> livingston , a spokesman for the center for legal cannabis , a recently formed research group .
<mask> would no longer be prosecuting small marijuana violations for anyone 21 years or older , and that the police would stop charging people for those crimes &quot; effective immediately . &quot;
<mask> said that the police would enforce city codes regulating medical marijuana growers , and that they would still pursue drug traffickers and dealers .
<mask> weld county , the district attorney , ken buck , represents a stricter view .
<mask> he said his office would continue pursuing marijuana possession cases , mostly as a way to press users into getting treatment .
<mask> or less of marijuana , though many are facing other charges .
<mask> at the time they occurred , &quot; mr. buck said in a statement .
<mask> like rural mesa county , where voters rejected the marijuana initiative .
<mask> no longer citing adults for possession of small amounts .
<mask> district attorney , pete hautzinger , supported that decision , but also decided not to dismiss all of the pending possession cases .
<mask> time continuing to enforce the law until it changes , &quot; he said .
<mask> be simple .
<mask> big green experiment .
<mask> of marijuana laws .
<mask> people that they still don &apos;t really accept that this is legal , &quot; he said .
<mask> treat small amounts of marijuana like alcohol , colorado and washington are poised to become national test cases for drug legalization .
<mask> , which still plans to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes .
<mask> for legalized marijuana are hoping the justice department yields .

<mask> mules of kawah ijen
<mask> volcano porters risk life and limb carrying 70 kilos of sulphur along steep stone paths .
<mask> for whom work is hell , and others who - literally - work in hell .
<mask> their living taking sulphur from the kawah ijen volcano , east of the indonesian island of java .
<mask> to the bottom of the crater , where the sulphurous gas emanating from the bowels of the earth solidifies on contact with air .
<mask> along the steep stone paths .
<mask> carefully to avoid slipping and falling over the precipice .
<mask> cost them their lives , as happened to a french tourist who plunged to her death a few years ago on the hazardous kawah ijen cliffs .
<mask> are paid 5 euro cents for each kilo of sulphur removed .
<mask> tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and then , lugging their heavy baskets , they walk three kilometres to the scales installed by a mining company a little further down , 1,850 metres above sea level .
<mask> is pt ngrimbi candi , a company which , since 1960 , has been exploiting the volcano , and quite literally its workers , whom it pays 662 rupees ( 5 euro cents ) per kilo of sulphur .
<mask> sugar .
<mask> rupees ( 3.8 euros ) a trip &quot; explains anto , who usually make three trips a day .
<mask> and you end up exhausted , but it means he gets 138,000 rupees ( 11.5 euros ) at the end of the day .
<mask> three times what he would earn in the field .
<mask> the porter , who previously worked as a mason in the island resort of bali .
<mask> &apos;ve brought her to java to convert to islam . &quot;
<mask> , he has difficulty breathing , coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases .
<mask> years in the kawah ijen volcano , and the sulphur has already begun to take its toll on him , even though he covers his face with special mask and goggles .
<mask> by the toxic gases from the volcano .
<mask> realise your dreams .
<mask> or french &quot; he vows in more than acceptable english .
<mask> , this pleasant , intelligent young man could be a tour guide , waiter or hotel receptionist , but instead he does the work of a mule .
<mask> two in the morning because the sulphur doesn &apos;t stop flowing at night , when its characteristic yellow colour turns blue and it glows in the dark .
<mask> a small torch attached to the helmet he bought with his money .
<mask> porters carry sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the crater .
<mask> nor has it provided any equipment for the porters , who work for themselves and by the kilo .
<mask> do not even see any of the 30,000 rupee ( 2.5 euro ) per camera surcharge that , on top of the 15,000 rupee ( 1.2 euro ) entrance fee , the guards of this natural reserve charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and their human mules .
<mask> 42 ##at##-##at## year porter who has been working at kawah ijen for three decades , since leaving school .
<mask> &#93; and 10 years old .
<mask> my whole life .
<mask> they are so hardy that no ##at##-##at## one complains of serious illnesses ... apart , of course , from their common respiratory problems , osteoarthritis , knee pain and sores on the shoulders , which have been misshapen by the weight of the baskets .
<mask> .
<mask> day , he and his fellow workers break off 15 tonnes of sulphur from the volcano , which three lorries move to the warehouse in tamansari , 18 kilometres away along a goat path that passes through scrubland .
<mask> mouth full of gaps where teeth use to be .
<mask> , 30 years old , also works carrying sulphur .

<mask> save its economy
<mask> property and education for not having children .
<mask> &apos;s population needs to grow . &quot;
<mask> &apos;s do our civic duty and create life !
<mask> - the video went viral on youtube in singapore earlier this year .
<mask> rate in singapore .
<mask> manage to focus attention to the problem in a fun way .
<mask> director , douglas hamilton , says he wanted to use the power of music to make people perform their &quot; national duty . &quot;
<mask> make it fun and amusing .
<mask> country .
<mask> , so we felt it was an issue we had to address .
<mask> government had tried many things , like launching perfumes with pheromones or organising speed dating evenings .
<mask> but they didn &apos;t necessarily work .
<mask> as creative as possible to solve the problem , by composing a rap ?
<mask> government is not taking it so lightly .
<mask> per year on policies to encourage people to have more children .
<mask> and distributes tax benefits .
<mask> effect .
<mask> is a rich , high technology city state in southeast asia , also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls .
<mask> , according to its national population division , currently stands at 1.2 children per woman .
<mask> over 2 , known as the replacement rate , was in 1976 .
<mask> children ?
<mask> policy of the national population division , said that it is a result of &quot; better education &quot; and &quot; a wider range of career opportunities . &quot;
<mask> of life goals and priorities , beyond getting married and starting a family &quot; he explains .
<mask> contributed to increasing numbers of people who are single , and delaying marriage and births , which has resulted in a decrease in the birth rate in singapore .
<mask> with the population decline has created resentment among the local population .
<mask> where xenophobia against many new immigrants is widespread and thinly disguised , especially the chinese who are criticised for keeping wages low and not integrating .
<mask> reasons why , last year , the singapore ruling party experienced its worst election result since independence .
<mask> the highest taxes and levies for foreign workers .
<mask> consequences
<mask> on a nation &apos;s economic growth , tax revenues , healthcare costs and immigration policies , in singapore &apos;s case there are also some unexpected consequences .
<mask> so many small houses .
<mask> influence the real estate sector .
<mask> , &quot; which can be built in certain areas of the city .
<mask> apartments have a surface of 46 square metres and have been very successful in terms of sales .
<mask> who want to build large family houses .
<mask> company el developers , says his &quot; shoe boxes &quot; sell much faster than larger units .
<mask> units sell days , even weeks , faster than larger units .
<mask> better for our cash flow .
<mask> he admits that the new regulations give clearer guidance to developers , who previously had obstacles put in their way if they provided for too many small units in a project .
<mask> stressed
<mask> a city state .
<mask> step towards increasing the national birth rate , when talking to singaporeans working in the central financial district , it seems they will not have much impact .
<mask> so a lot of people are putting off having a family &quot; says a young executive .
<mask> have children .
<mask> &quot; says another young man of around 20 years old .
<mask> , stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons preventing them from having children .
<mask> babies , the singaporeans have the last word .

<mask> an under 16 ?
<mask> daily life and social networks ?
<mask> they probably would not share offline ?
<mask> frequent internet users .
<mask> &quot; something very much mine &quot; on a personal level , and &quot; in the user name and password &quot; when applied to social networks .
<mask> of privacy on sites such as facebook , twitter , hotmail and windows live messenger , with which he has had accounts for two years .
<mask> not everybody &quot; he says .
<mask> pictures or games .
<mask> people i know .
<mask> that belongs to somebody who &apos;s doing something stupid &quot; he says .
<mask> that it is bad to post obscene pictures of naked people , crimes , or write humiliating or aggressive comments .
<mask> his nine followers on twitter .
<mask> .
<mask> has the password to one of the accounts .
<mask> post interesting tweets .
<mask> .
<mask> talk quickly to relatives far away or my friends &quot; he says .
<mask> would never accept a request from an unknown person .
<mask> take any notice of someone who recommends a stranger to him .
<mask> 14 , is different .
<mask> last case he admits not knowing 20 of the people added to his friends list .
<mask> , because we have something in common , like music &quot; he says .
<mask> ##at##-##at## one has suggested anything to him or asked him for his home address or phone number .
<mask> it , i &apos;d just delete them from my account &quot; he states .
<mask> a recommendation on twitter .
<mask> not alien to experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying .
<mask> a social network .
<mask> threatening him and demanding money from him .
<mask> he says .
<mask> his account .
<mask> made it private . &quot;
<mask> account safely .
<mask> of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations .
<mask> , or they made me want to do it .
<mask> i know that &apos;s cyberbullying &quot; he admits .
<mask> questions
<mask> in education and learning , believes that to guide children and teenagers , they should understand that the purpose of social media is to inform .
<mask> but with the appearance of these websites , the rules of the game changed &quot; he says .
<mask> the work digital natives , digital immigrants , coined these terms to explain the phenomenon .
<mask> natives are those children and young people born with technology .
<mask> immigrants who have to teach them , when we are still in fact learning &quot; he says .
<mask> is complex , &quot; because we are asking them to have a clear policy on what is appropriate or not to disclose , publish or divulge , at an age at which maturity is not conducive to this . &quot;
<mask> the consequences &quot; he adds .
<mask> most effective way to teach children and teenagers what privacy is , is through questions that make them think .
<mask> &quot; he adds .
<mask> so why do it online ?
<mask> the one you posted of a friend ?
<mask> publish about you ?
<mask> did you ask the other people &apos;s permission to tag them ?
<mask> everyone need to know what you &apos;re doing all the time ?
<mask> see that they must behave online as they do offline .
<mask> are the same .
<mask> social networks &quot; he says .
<mask> for parents to read social networks &apos; policies thoroughly .
<mask> to their children about the implications of opening an online account .
<mask> the age at which you are allowed to share or publish &quot; he says .
<mask> &quot; don &apos;t talk to strangers &quot; lesson .
<mask> without making public the lima declaration

<mask> citizenship &quot; says rafael correa
<mask> citizenship is a goal that &quot; south america , in this case , must learn from europe . &quot;
<mask> other conflicts , &quot; but are now practically one country . &quot;
<mask> project to establish south american citizenship encouraged by member countries of unasur .
<mask> workers for any south american country , as is already the situation with members of the andean community . however , there are still reactionary sectors that want us to return to the past &quot; he said .
<mask> the pact of san josé on human rights .
<mask> authority never commit to anything , whereas we south americans sign everything .
<mask> political asylum to wikileaks founder julian assange .
<mask> does not regret that decision because with it he has not betrayed his principles , but has respected his &quot; deep democratic and human rights values . &quot;
<mask> &quot; he had reasonable suspicion that assange would be extradited to another country and that his case would not be respected . &quot;
<mask> be done from the ecuadorian embassy in london . &quot;
<mask> risk of deterioration of assange &apos;s physical and mental health .
<mask> had a minor lung problem , nothing serious &quot; said the ecuadorian president .
<mask> deteriorate due to being locked in a small space without any outdoor exercise .
<mask> would complicate the health of any person &quot; he added .
<mask> talks with london to seek a solution to the imprisonment of the wikileaks founder .
<mask> this case , but there have been ongoing discussions .
<mask> lawyer , baltazar garzon , is handling a series of cases in different european courts &quot; he said .
<mask> conduct pass , it &apos;s over . &quot;
<mask> or interrogates him via skype tomorrow , this problem is over .
<mask> took the opportunity to reassert himself as a defender of freedom of the press and stated that what he does not tolerate is &quot; the mediocrity , dishonesty and lies that undermine the freedom of expression . &quot;
<mask> journalists depending on profit , blackmail and extortion &quot; he said .
<mask> re ##at##-##at## elected , he will &quot; step up the revolution to continue on the same path and in the right direction . &quot;
<mask> least until their next elections , arguing that the body &quot; must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and a coup masked with legality &quot; because this will in fact &quot; destroy the legitimacy of paraguayan democracy . &quot;
<mask> maritime boundary between the two countries , after the ruling of the international court of justice in the hague , in favour nicaraguan maritime sovereignty .
<mask> is not being followed .
<mask> american country and a central american one .
<mask> must be overcome by the desire to walk together .
<mask> manner to overcome them and move forward .
<mask> right for latin america to refer to international courts if both countries agree to accept losing , however hard it may be . &quot;
<mask> possibility of his standing as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in ecuador seeking a third consecutive term , he said he sees that possibility &quot; with much optimism and joy , although at times it is pretty hard . &quot;
<mask> retire from public life .
<mask> in ecuador , socio ##at##-##at## economic poverty can only be corrected by political power .
<mask> was me who ensured that probable victory , so we have to accept that responsibility &quot; he said .
<mask> then i would leave public life .
<mask> likewise .
<mask> &quot; he confirmed .
<mask> &apos;s new health treatment in cuba .

<mask> mean a health relapse for president chavez &quot; he said .
<mask> and security .
<mask> to late detection
<mask> old when they confirmed his test result : hiv positive .
<mask> he says , recalling the time of the announcement , which the doctor was trying to make &quot; softer , &quot; apparently unsuccessfully .
<mask> .
<mask> his efforts he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday .
<mask> of the guadalajara civil hospital ( chg ) , where he arrived in 1994 after several battles with his health .
<mask> the early &apos; 90s , when there were many questions , few treatment options and a great deal of stigma .
<mask> even the director of an imss &#91; mexican social security institute &#93; clinic refused to discharge him &quot; because he had a cut . &quot;
<mask> was synonymous with death .
<mask> do so with quality of life .
<mask> and they are suffering from opportunistic infections .
<mask> at least since the first reported cases , &quot; the great achievement at this time is that the life expectancy of patients starting treatment in good time and the life expectancy of the general population is exactly equal &quot; stated the head of the chg hiv unit , jaime andrade villanueva , saying that this information was endorsed in april this year in a prestigious scientific journal .
<mask> andrade villanueva said that since 2008 scientists had concluded that aids was not a death sentence , but that life expectancy and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the immune system that patients present when they are diagnosed , with a higher life expectancy for non ##at##-##at## drug users : up to 30 years for patients with a 200 cd4 count and 50 years for those reporting a 500 cd4 count .
<mask> diagnosed hiv positive at 25 years old , under these terms and &quot; as long as they keep it under control , can live with no problems to 75 &quot; said the interviewee .
<mask> mexicans today is 76 years .
<mask> the number of people dying of aids has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 ( unaids annual report ) , it is also true that since the advent of aids , 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died .
<mask> 187 deaths up to may of this year ; however , we are assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005 .
<mask> occur ?
<mask> access to treatment .
<mask> how it &apos;s been at our hospital .
<mask> had no shortage of medicine , the problem is that patients arrive in an advanced state of illness because they are unaware of their hiv status , that is to say , the later stages of the disease .
<mask> be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and , therefore , offer mass detection tests for everyone who needs them . &quot;
<mask> prevention in jalisco ( coesida ) agree on this proposal , as do the patients themselves , such as fabrizio , who came to be tested at a private laboratory , motivated only because a friend had done so and , despite his young age , he was around in the aids era and had even suffered kaposi sarcoma , a cancerous tumour that is one of the common complications .
<mask> you have aids .
<mask> don &apos;t want to know anything .
<mask> , but not in my case .
<mask> the better ; i eat well , i exercise , i take my drugs .
<mask> aware he had cancer .
<mask> as normal a life as anyone else .
<mask> , who agreed to share his intimate secrets with milenio jalisco , to motivate those people with his story who today , in the context of world aids day , are afraid .

<mask> is his message , which summarises the theme of the fight against aids in 2012 .

<mask> .
<mask> to give us one or two , now they give us packets of a hundred , and that &apos;s fine , but it turns out there are still people out there who have no access condoms &quot; he said .
<mask> the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers .
<mask> a common question , asked with sarcasm and judged according to the values of social workers , counsellors , pharmacy workers and healthcare staff who do not want to expose teenagers to sex , said the speaker .
<mask> not only be placed behind counters , but that packets of one hundred should be found in public toilet dispensers in places frequented by young people .
<mask> not promoting promiscuity .
<mask> fees , as governor emilio gonzalez said , when asked if there would be distribution of condoms during his administration .
<mask> provide condoms to those already practising sexual activity &quot; he said .
<mask> points
<mask> are 13,435 cumulative cases ( 12,158 aids and 1,317 hiv ) .
<mask> is 4th in the nation in new and cumulative cases of aids and 13th in hiv .
<mask> perinatal .
<mask> 50,000 people may be living with hiv , as for each registered case there are around 4 ##at##-##at## 5 people who do not know they are positive .
