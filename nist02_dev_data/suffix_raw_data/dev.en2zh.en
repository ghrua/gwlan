the topics of the conversation covered the world economy and the shortcomings of " windows " operation system , and bill gates was also invited to visit quebec at an appropriate time .
the radio station aired the recording of the conversation in its entertainment program on the evening of the 2nd , and on the next day re-aired it at the request of its listeners .

the new yorker weekly : iraqi intelligence agency in close contact with al qaeda for years
( washington , syndicated news ) the most recent issue of the new yorker weekly reports that for years the iraqi intelligence agency has been in close contact with al qaeda network led by osama who masterminded the september 11 attacks .
it is reported that these two organizations jointly command a terrorist organization in the kurdish area of northern iraq .
the cia has always been skeptical about the claim that iraqi president hussein has been in touch with al qaeda network .
the " hawks " in the bush administration who support military actions against iraq have been trying in the past to find evidence of hussein 's ties with al qaeda network .
the day before yesterday , these officials praised highly the report by the new yorker weekly , saying the report is the latest evidence that supports their argument .

as los angeles was the destination of flight sq-006 , some of the victims ' families have already taken the case to the us court for huge sums of civil compensation , suing not only singapore airlines but also taiwan civil aviation administration .
the lawsuit by the victims ' families for compensation is tantamount to accusing taiwan aviation administration 's control tower of negligence of duty. therefore , the result of the investigation by taoyuan prosecutor 's office will draw all the more attention .

hundreds of thousands of us and south korean soldiers to launch large-scale military exercise
( seoul , afp ) on thursday , hundreds of thousands of us and south korean soldiers will launch a largest military exercise in history which will simulate a conflict with north korea. pyongyang angrily labeled it as a provocation of war .
the us officers said on the eve of the week-long military exercise that the drill is purely defensive in nature , but it just takes place after south korean authorities warned that the danger of north korea is not to be ignored .
this is the largest-scale military exercise since the 1950-53 korean war. as no formal agreement has been signed to end the conflict in the korean peninsular , the place has become the last front of the cold war in the world. about 2 million soldiers are facing each other across the border .
the us-south korean combined forces command ( cfc ) in seoul said that the military exercise from march 21 to march 27 will be testing for the first time the effectiveness of combining two different joint military exercises .
this means hundreds of thousands of soldiers will participate , but the military did not reveal any details .
the cfc spokesman said this exercise will mobilize almost every us and south korean military unit in the korean peninsular and the us military from the outside .
37,000 american soldiers are permanently stationed in south korea to prevent 1.1 million north korean soldiers from attacking the south .
south korea also has 650,000 soldiers .
the cfc named this exercise rs0i / fe02 , a combination of computerized military exercise with the annual " foal eagle " exercise .
in the past few years , 500,000 south korean soldiers and 30,000 us soldiers were mobilized for rs0i exercise alone ( including 20,000 us soldiers from the outside ) .
north korea accused the united states of launching the military exercise with an intention to provoke the war .

china steps up security in embassy district to prevent north koreans from " storming embassies " again
( hong kong ) the chinese police recently conducted an internal review over the incident that 25 north koreans stormed the spanish embassy last week .

the sources pointed out , staff from the south korean embassy indicated to the chinese officials that south korea does not encourage north koreans to go to south korea through this means and south korea does not hope to see similar incidents again so that the relations between china and the korean peninsula are not affected. south korea also promises china that it will assist china in managing the south korean residents in beijing .
it is disclosed that about 10,000 ethnic koreans live in the eastern district of beijing and liangmahe in chaoyang district. among them are ethnic koreans from northeast china and those from north and south koreas. they are mainly engaged in korean style restaurant and bar businesses. since they belong to the same korean ethnic group , they get along quite well with each other no matter where they come from .
in the past , the authorities did not consider the ethnic koreans as the focus of their supervision because they were not big in number in beijing , nor did they get involved in so many criminal offenses like those people from xinjiang and henan .
it is reported that after the march 14 incident , the public security agency first " invited " the german doctor who assisted those 25 north koreans for a " talk " at the public security agency and then escorted him to the airport for immediate departure from china .
afterwards , the public security agency and the national security agency started an internal review .
the review mainly consists of two parts : the security protection of the embassy district and the management of the ethnic koreans in beijing .
in addition , the authorities also required the relevant agencies in regions such as jilin to take effective measures to prevent north koreans who have illegally crossed the border from entering beijing .

williams from the international astronomical union 's minor planet center located in cambridge , massachusetts had helped locate the position of the asteroid .
from the astronomical perspective , this asteroid is very close to the earth , because the moon is 402,000 km away from the earth .
williams told " florida today " on wednesday : " it is of critical importance the asteroid should have been detected before it came from the direction of the sun . "
in this way , astronomers will be able to verify the orbit of the asteroid as soon as possible and predict whether it will bump into the earth .
in 1908 when an asteroid about the same size hit the earth , it caused a pit as wide as 32 kilometers in the forests of siberia .
interior minister confirms senior italian government advisor shot by " red brigade "
( rome , afp ) italian interior minister scajola confirmed the day before yesterday that the senior italian government advisor biagi was shot to death by a branch unit of the extremist left-wing guerrilla " red brigade . "
scajola said , the two men who killed biagi even used the same pistol that was used to carry out a similar political assassination three years ago .
on the other hand , after biagi 's assassination , the italian prime minister berlusconi offered to invite the labor union leaders back to the negotiation table and to discuss the employment reform plan he proposed .
biagi , the 52-year-old advisor for the ministry of labor , was also an economist and law professor .
he was killed by a gunman on a motorcycle when he was riding his bike back to his home in the northern city of bologna. the shooting shocked the italian political circle .
biagi had assisted in drafting an employment reform plan that was strongly opposed by the labor union and the leftists .
they believed the plan would make it easier for employers to fire workers .
eyewitnesses said that biagi was lying in a pool of blood alongside his briefcase .
the door of biagi 's home was also found to be carved with a red brigade symbol of five stars , but at this time it is not clear when the symbol was carved .
established in 1973 , red brigade was suspected in many bombings and assassinations in italy during the 70s and 80s , including the abduction and murder of the former prime minister moro in 1978 .
chinese american engineer sentenced to 5-year imprisonment for illegally obtaining china 's state secrets and bribery
( beijing , ap ) beijing no.1 intermediate people 's court yesterday sentenced the chinese american engineer fang fuming to 5 years in prison on charges of illegally obtaining state secrets and bribing on behalf of a company .
the case had aroused protests from the united states .
the spokesman for the us embassy in china said that fang fuming will be deported from china after he serves his time .
the time of his sentence will be adjusted according to the time he has already served .
the us embassy had sent a diplomat to attend the hearing .
the attorney representing fang fuming said that his client has already been imprisoned for two years , but china said it was not that long .
xinhua news agency confirmed the ruling .
it said , from 1995 to 1999 , fang fuming obtained 35 documents containing state secrets and gave 245,000 us dollars ( about 450,000 singapore dollars in current value ) in bribes to state workers to assist foreign investors bidding for china 's power construction projects .
fang fuming was an electrical engineering consultant for a foreign company in its china and other asian offices .
cohen , the attorney representing fang fuming , said that fang fuming denied giving bribes and said he was a victim to the embezzling chinese officials in the power industry .
once a chinese official in the power industry , fang fuming became a us citizen in 1994 .
in the past two years , a number of us citizens and residents were accused of violating the chinese national security laws. fang fuming was one of them .
the arrest of fang fuming had temporarily caused tensions between china and the united states .
the us government repeatedly protested against the way china handled the case of fang fuming , accusing the chinese authorities of violating the international norms by detaining fang fuming for several months without any trial .
the family members of fang fuming said he was badly treated .
his wife and two children are all us citizens .
cohen said , fang fuming was detained on february 28 , 2000 , but the date of custody set by the chinese foreign ministry is august 28 , 2000 .
china called off naval fleet 's visit to the us , declined to confirm whether hu jintao will visit us as planned
( beijing , syndicated news ) the sino-us relation that was heated momentarily by the us president bush 's visit to china is cooling down rapidly. china confirmed yesterday that it has called off its naval fleet visit to the us ports this year and refused to confirm whether the country 's vice president hu jintao will visit the united states as planned .
the foreign ministry spokeswoman zhang qiyue said while answering reporters ' questions at a routine press conference : " as far as i know , china 's naval fleet is preparing for a visit as planned ; its itinerary does not include the us ports . "
when a reporter asked her twice whether hu jintao 's plan to visit the united states is affected and whether she can clarify that an earlier answer can be interpreted as an indication that hu jintao will visit the us in april as scheduled , zhang qiyue would not make any further comments nor would she confirm anything .
zhang qiyue only repeatedly accused the us of " doing a series of things that violate the three joint communiques between china and the us " within a short period of one month after president bush 's visit to china and demanded that the us " stop using the issue of taiwan to interfere in china 's internal affairs . "
on the other hand , in washington d.c. , the us ignored on wednesday china 's warning that a " chilly wind " is blowing over the sino-us relations and insisted that there is nothing wrong with the us permission of taiwan 's defense minister to attend " us-taiwan defense summit " held in florida .
beijing repeatedly attacked the us for issuing a visa to taiwan 's defense minister tang yiau-ming earlier this month and allowing him to attend a conference sponsored by the us arms manufacturers .
tang yiau-ming also met with two senior us officials at the time .
at a routine press conference , state department spokesman boucher was hounded by reporters asking about china 's complaints over this issue , but obviously he was trying his best to avoid a battle of words with china .
he said : " after this meeting , our position is well-known to all .
if you want to ask me about this every day , i am willing to explain it every day. if china wants to ask about this every day , we are willing to explain it every day . "
he said : " the position hasn 't changed. these are our normal contacts with the taiwanese. we will continue to do so . "
zhang qiyue also confirmed yesterday the russian media 's report , saying that the chinese president jiang zemin called the russian president putin by phone at his request the night before , and both sides exchanged their opinions on cooperations between china and russia based on mutual benefits .
both sides believe it is in the interest of both nations and peoples to develop mutually beneficial cooperations between china and russia .
