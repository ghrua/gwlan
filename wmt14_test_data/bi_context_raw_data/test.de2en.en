gutach : increased <mask> for pedestrians
they are not even 100 metres apart : on tuesday , the new b 33 pedestrian lights in dorfparkplatz in gutach <mask> the existing town hall traffic lights .
two sets of lights so close to one another <mask> just a silly error ?
yesterday , gutacht &apos;s mayor <mask> a clear answer to this question .
&quot; at the time <mask> &quot; explained eckert yesterday .
the kluser lights protect cyclists , as well as those travelling by <mask> bergle .
the <mask> sulzbachweg / kirchstrasse junction .
we have the museum , two churches , the spa gardens , the bus stop , a doctor &apos;s practice and a bank , not to mention the traffic from the <mask> area .
&quot; at times of high road and pedestrian traffic , an additional set of lights were <mask> ensure safety , &quot; said eckert .
this was also confirmed by peter arnold from the <mask> .
&quot; according to current measurements , around 12,000 vehicles travel through the town of gutach on the b33 on a daily basis , of which heavy goods <mask> emphasised arnold .
therefore the construction of an additional set of lights was more than necessary : &quot; here safety comes first , it &apos;s that simple <mask> arnold .
a total of four road safety inspections were carried out and a roundabout was also considered , however , this idea was rejected <mask> the narrowness of the sulzbachweg / kirchstrasse junctions .
according to arnold <mask> whether such vehicles could access the b 33 from the sulzbachweg without knocking over the traffic light posts &quot; .
the traffic light system itself , which cost around eur 15,000 , is <mask> on the market , &quot; explained arnold .
the system is fitted with coloured leds , which are bright enough that drivers can <mask> the lights , even when the sun is low in the sky .
and they are also energy ##at##-##at## efficient : the older light systems consume around 100 <mask> consuming just eight .
there are three sets of <mask> direction of travel .
arnold explained the <mask> new system : it is fitted with two radar sensors .
if the pedestrian presses the button at the traffic <mask> checks the traffic status .
if the street is clear , the pedestrian obtains a green light immediately , <mask> is a delay of around 15 seconds .
an additional radar sensor checks whether the green <mask> for the pedestrian can be ended .
&quot; if a group of people or if disabled persons are crossing the street , the green phase is extended , thus ensuring that everyone gets safely <mask> the street , &quot; explained arnold .
of course , drivers <mask> eyes on the road .
yesterday this was not the case : the light had barely turned green <mask> red light .
for more than 30 years , josef winkler has been writing from the heart , <mask> and youth .
the catastrophes of his catholic village upbringing - the speechlessness , his tendency <mask> of this has been described many times by the kaernten ##at##-##at## born poet .
the büchner prizewinner is known primarily as a writer of prose , with theatre texts something of a <mask> him .
in a collage of prose texts for his performance piece , &quot; wetterleuchten auf der zungenspitze &quot; ( summer lightning on the tip of your tongue ) , which can now be seen in garage x on petersplatz , gerhard fresacher <mask> prose texts .
the theatre producer has thus combined elements from the autobiographically inspired novel <mask> , seine familie belauernd &quot; ( 2003 ) &#91; corpse , stalking his family &#93; .
on the predominantly empty stage - with one important requirement : a crumpled sofa , on which cast <mask> the text material .
however , director fresacher seems to have little trust <mask> .
the 70 ##at##-##at## minute performance glosses over the script with a host of director &apos;s additions , well ##at##-##at## known from the repertoire of post ##at##-##at## dramatic <mask> styles .
in particular , the actresses play a major role in the <mask> staging .
they are manhandled , their heads held under water , tacked to the wall by <mask> evening gowns .
wrapped in cellophane or in girdles , they stumble <mask> the top of their voices or lying completely silent on the stage .
however , the source text makes barely any <mask> intense delivery .
the best moments of <mask> range from deep purple to traditional folk songs .
only towards the end does the highly charged performance <mask> of winkler &apos;s somewhat absurd sense of humour .
a <mask> your car ?
as america &apos;s road planners struggle to find the cash to <mask> , many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box that fits neatly by the dashboard of your car .
the devices , which track every mile a motorist drives and transmit that information to bureaucrats , <mask> .
the usually dull arena <mask> and colorful alliances .
libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying to allow government to use the little boxes to keep track of the miles you drive , and possibly where you drive them - then use <mask> to draw up a tax bill .
the <mask> aghast .
the american <mask> , raising a variety of privacy issues .
and while congress can &apos;t agree on whether to proceed , several states are not <mask> .
they are exploring how , over the next <mask> which drivers pay per mile of road they roll over .
thousands of motorists have already taken the black boxes , some of which have gps <mask> , for a test drive .
this <mask> is a must for our nation .
&quot; it is not a matter of something we might choose to do , &quot; said hasan ikhrata , executive director of the southern california assn. of governments , which is planning for the state to start tracking miles driven <mask> by 2025 .
there is <mask> pay these taxes .
the technology is <mask> to do it .
the push comes as the country &apos;s highway trust fund , <mask> broke .
americans don &apos;t <mask> as they used to .
cars get many <mask> the gallon .
the federal tax itself , <mask> .
politicians are loath to raise the <mask> one penny when gas prices are high .
&quot; the gas tax is just not sustainable , &quot; said lee munnich , <mask> the university of minnesota .
his state recently put tracking devices <mask> ##at##-##at## mile system .
&quot; this works out as the most logical alternative over the long term , &quot; he <mask> .
wonks call it a <mask> .
it is no surprise that the idea appeals to urban liberals , as the taxes could be rigged to change driving <mask> in ways that could help reduce congestion and greenhouse gases , for example .
california planners are looking to the system as they devise <mask> goals laid out in the state &apos;s ambitious global warming laws .
but rep. bill shuster ( r ##at##-##at## pa . ) , chairman of the house transportation committee , has said he <mask> alternative .
the free marketeers at the reason foundation are also fond <mask> drivers pay per mile .
&quot; this is <mask> moore , vice president of policy at reason .
people are paying more directly into what they <mask> .
the movement is also bolstered by <mask> ##at##-##at## per ##at##-##at## mile direction .
the u.s. senate approved a $ <mask> cars .
but <mask> lots of miles to get to work or into town .
several states <mask> are nonetheless moving ahead on their own .
the most eager is oregon , which is enlisting 5,000 drivers in the <mask> .
those drivers will <mask> the mileage fees instead of gas taxes to the state .
nevada <mask> completed a pilot .
new <mask> looking into one .
illinois is trying it on a limited basis <mask> .
and the i ##at##-##at## 95 coalition , which includes 17 state transportation departments along the eastern seaboard ( including maryland , pennsylvania , virginia and florida ) , is studying <mask> could go about implementing the change .
the concept <mask> .
in nevada , where about 50 volunteers &apos; cars were equipped with the devices not long ago , drivers were uneasy about <mask> to monitor their every move .
&quot; concerns <mask> were a major problem , &quot; said alauddin khan , who directs strategic and performance management at the nevada department of transportation .
it was not something people <mask> .
as the trial got underway , the aclu of nevada warned on <mask> website : &quot; it would be fairly easy to turn these devices into full ##at##-##at## fledged tracking devices . &quot;
there is no need to build an <mask> keep records of individuals &apos; everyday comings and goings .
nevada is among several states now <mask> to keep track of how many miles a car is being driven , but not exactly where and at what time .
if you can do that , khan said <mask> more comfortable .
the hunt for that technology has <mask> small california startup called true mileage .
the firm was <mask> business of helping states tax drivers .
it was seeking to break into an emerging market <mask> which drivers would pay based on their mileage .
but the devices it is testing appeal to highway planners because they don &apos;t use gps and deliver a limited amount of information <mask> modem .
&quot; people will be more willing to do <mask> track their speed and you do not track their location , &quot; said ryan morrison , chief executive of true mileage .
there have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilot <mask> .
there are a lot less expensive and less <mask> to do this .
in <mask> choices .
they can choose a device with <mask> .
or they <mask> flat fee based on the average number of miles driven by all state residents .
other places are hoping to sell the concept to a <mask> devices do more , not less .
in new york city , transportation officials are seeking to develop a taxing device that would <mask> real ##at##-##at## time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic .
&quot; motorists would be attracted to participate because of the value <mask> , &quot; says a city planning document .
some transportation planners , though , wonder if all the talk about paying by the mile <mask> .
at the metropolitan transportation commission in the san francisco bay area , officials <mask> with the bankrupt highway trust fund by raising gas taxes .
an extra one ##at##-##at## time or annual levy <mask> imposed on drivers of hybrids and others whose vehicles don &apos;t use much gas , so they pay their fair share .
&quot; there is no need for radical surgery when all you need to do is take an aspirin , &quot; said randy rentschler , <mask> director of legislation and public affairs .
if we do this <mask> be concerned about their privacy and a host of other things .
königsfeld : small <mask> gives a spirited performance
the voluntary <mask> test run in spite of a lack of personnel .
only <mask> took part in the exercise .
for <mask> kammerer , chose the feder premises on burgberger strasse .
a short ##at##-##at## circuit was reported to have <mask> there during sawing .
two people were injured by the resulting fire and the <mask> call .
two fire fighters equipped with respiratory gear prepared to enter the building <mask> .
after a short time they managed to find <mask> the building .
the second <mask> carried .
this was not so simple as they <mask> a narrow stairwell .
the building , a workshop with integrated stabling for two horses , was not easy to <mask> .
there were large quantities of <mask> bales of straw stored inside .
in addition to this , there were also electrical machines for wood <mask> .
the first attempt to extinguish the fire was made <mask> the fire engine .
another <mask> was taken from the surface hydrant around 100 metres away .
only three attempts could be <mask> blaze .
a hollow ##at##-##at## stream nozzle in <mask> was also used .
for hans kammerer , the exercise was also a chance to show what can be achieved with just a few available <mask> .
in case of emergency , support <mask> daytime task force .
the commander <mask> the exercise .
networking <mask> important
on a visit to the <mask> workforce of tomorrow will come from .
in the hochschwarzwald support centre , he addressed this important question alongside the executive principals <mask> council .
&quot; education is <mask> of the hans thoma school , which introduced the networked hochschwarzwald education centre schools project .
during the presentation <mask> educational pilot project .
since 2011 <mask> , the district grammar school and the vocational school complex .
he also praised the family ##at##-##at## friendly approach <mask> district .
&quot; it is important , not only to keep <mask> term care and support for relatives as well , &quot; explained wolf .
he also stated that an increasing number of employed persons are looking after the long ##at##-##at## <mask> relatives .
&quot; without support from <mask> contract , &quot; said wolf .
however , nobody can afford to lose qualified <mask> .
another , particularly important factor is that of networking <mask> and companies .
&quot; after all , people who have learned of the merits of the region during their studies often remain within the <mask> strengthening of the region , &quot; said the state parliamentary president , expressing his thorough conviction .
for it is only if a sufficient number of educational places can be provided that the need <mask> .
in his opinion , the district <mask> in south ##at##-##at## west germany , in immediate proximity to france and switzerland .
in addition <mask> to freiburg , he experienced first ##at##-##at## hand the efforts already undertaken to develop public transport .
&quot; you must continue to be <mask> given to the local politicians in attendance .
music <mask> for an entertaining afternoon
it was 15 years ago that the kaul family first invited the dietingen senior citizens for coffee and <mask> a snack .
previously , the elderly citizens were hosted in the <mask> station canteen .
the coffee afternoon is now held in the st. <mask> .
the residents of the home were delighted with the <mask> and tarts .
later on , a sausage salad was <mask> .
silvia kimmich ##at##-##at## <mask> with popular tunes .
the more than 100 ##at##-##at## year ##at##-##at## <mask> again feature on the renovation cost plan for the town of bräunlingen .
in the days before the kilbig autumn folk festival , when the first renovation work was being carried out at the front of the school yard , a small corner wall with <mask> is more than one hundred years old .
according to alexander misok of the bräunlingen municipal planning and building control authority , the ongoing procedure plans to involve the <mask> the old wall .
a cost calculation is to be performed by a team of professionals , which will then be <mask> ongoing procedure .
a decision is expected <mask> year .
following the renovation , plastering and planting of trees in the old internal school yard , within the two wings of the 1912 school , as a subsequent measure the boundary wall , which is in need of refurbishment , must be <mask> up within the foreseeable future .
the historic , one hundred ##at##-##at## year ##at##-##at## old boundary wall between the old school ##at##-##at## yard and kirchstrasse is in need of renovation , primarily as a result of water and <mask> drainage , and is leaning forwards .
deep cracks in a number of individual stones testify to the weather damage <mask> in danger of collapse .
a secure wall is essential for a school yard that is used by pupils , <mask> of the current fortification work .
the school yard renovation was originally planned back in 2008 / 2009 , however , high <mask> had to be pushed back .
the regional memorial authority will have a major say in the historic school wall renovation , which has even been used <mask> .
if this authority were to <mask> the town of bräunlingen would hope to receive subsidies from the monument preservationists .
the pupils of the bräunlingen primary school , who are now being taught in a well renovated old school building , with a new <mask> be able to use the old school yard as well .

us borders : &quot; super tunnel &quot; for <mask> smuggling discovered
on the border between mexico and the <mask> intended for drug smuggling .
as announced by the us customs authorities , the pipe between tijuana and san diego , measuring more than 500 metres in length , was equipped with electricity , a railway track and a <mask> system .
three suspects were detained in <mask> to the discovery , with eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine seized .
according to the details provided , the tunnel had not yet been put <mask> use .
&quot; these cartels are stupid if they think that they can dig through under the radar , &quot; said the us attorney for the district of southern california , laura diffy , at a press conference held in front of <mask> san diego , where the end of the tunnel was discovered .
referring to the drug <mask> , we are determined to make this a big waste of your dirty money &quot; .
both the us authorities and the mexican security <mask> engaged in an ongoing battle against the drug cartels .
since 2006 , more than 77,000 <mask> mexico .
built <mask> experts
due to the elaborate configuration of the tunnel , investigators are working on the assumption <mask> was build by architects and engineers and that the construction took around one year .
the railway system was equipped in such a way that <mask> could be used on it .
on the <mask> metres from the border .
according to the authorities , a <mask> the tunnel .
the tunnel has a cross ##at##-##at## section <mask> 90 centimetres across .
it <mask> assist illegal immigration into the usa .
two of the <mask> .
the third <mask> the seizure of the marijuana .
all three face a maximum penalty of life imprisonment , according to the <mask> .
since 2006 , eight tunnels of this type have been discovered , the press conference <mask> continued .
however , this was the first time that cocaine was found <mask> .
normally cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not through <mask> .
this shows the &quot; desperation &quot; of the drug gangs , whose traditional routes have now been <mask> bill sherman of the dea drug squad in san diego .
they will do <mask> the usa .
no specific details were given regarding those detained , but it is reported that <mask> mexican

2014 is to be a year <mask> in geisingen
the anniversary celebrations in the town of <mask> the 1,250th
anniversary of the first documented mention of the town , are drawing <mask> .
when <mask> end in just eight weeks , the anniversary year will be upon us .
geisingen and kirchen ##at##-##at## hausen were first <mask> in the year 794 .
a deed was <mask> mentioned .
on 15 march , the anniversary year will be officially launched , and because geisingen currently has no suitable venues , this launch event will take place in the location where the two towns were <mask> kirchen ##at##-##at## hausen .
as <mask> of the anniversary celebrations , a number of events are planned both in geisingen and kirchen ##at##-##at## hausen .
kirchen ##at##-##at## hausen will <mask> 20
on the friday there will be a ceremony , and on <mask> party will be held at the kirchtalhalle .
the kirchen ##at##-##at## hausen kirchenfest festival will also be held on this celebratory <mask> .
town musical director , rudolf barth , has composed <mask> on three dates .
on 21 june , in conjunction with the schwarzwaldverein &#91; black forest association &#93; mid ##at##-##at## summer festival , on 12 july in the arena , accompanied by fireworks , and on 13 december as the first concert put on by the stadtmusik ( town musical <mask> .
this venue will be completed and inaugurated in the <mask> set for the last weekend in september , on 27 and 28 september .
on the occasion of the <mask> new chronicle will also be published .
&quot; however , it will not merely be a chronicle of geisingen itself , but rather a printed work on <mask> kirchen ##at##-##at## hausen , leipferdingen , aulfingen and gutmadingen , &quot; said mayor walter hengstler .
and the geisingen of today is also celebrating a birthday in 2014 , as it was in <mask> to form the current region were completed .
the new chronicle is to be presented on 21 or <mask> hall in geisingen .
however , 2014 is also <mask> .
the narrenzunft strohglonki ( strohglonki fool &apos;s guild celebration ) begins on 8 february with an evening of traditional <mask> may will be celebrating the bezirksfest &#91; district music festival &#93; .
the leipferdingen nursing home will turn 40 years old , the geisingen school has now been at its new location for 50 years and will be celebrating this on 10 may , and the polyhymnia leipferdingen music association will turn 150 years old and will <mask> part of the brunnenfest &#91; fountain festival &#93; from 4 to 7 july .
the town of geisingen was first officially documented in the year 764 , in a deed of donation , which is now in the possession of the st. <mask> .
the deed was drawn up in kirchen ( hausen ) , which at the time <mask> courthouse .
both communities <mask> the same deed .
one reason for choosing <mask> year anniversary in this way , is that it also coincides with the 40th anniversary of the community reform ( gemeindereform ) .
council sets its sights on <mask> system
should the &quot; am hirschen &quot; railway crossing be reconstructed at great cost , in order to increase <mask> safety ?
the town <mask> is yes .
schiltach will have to contribute up to <mask> .
the deutsche bahn hopes to <mask> line in the coming year .
in particular , safety <mask> frequently occur at these across the country .
if the municipalities agree to the reconstruction measures , they will be required to contribute one third of the <mask> the remainder divided between deutsche bahn and the federal government .
schiltach <mask> of the &quot; am hirschen &quot; railway crossing to the town council .
at the crossing , the town is planning to increase the height of the mouth of the <mask> the railway line .
larger vehicles , for example those that transport long logs <mask> be able to wait there in the event of oncoming traffic , without having to block the railway line .
grießhaber <mask> could in due course widen the adjoining street in order to guarantee the smooth flow of traffic .
this was the subject of controversial discussion in the town council , as some council members cast doubt over the need to widen the road : thomas kipp summarised the perspective of the critics with this <mask> so much money on account of so few vehicles ? &quot;
mayor thomas haas retorted : the &quot; hirschen &quot; railway <mask> for the transportation of long logs .
even wood from the &quot; kuhbach &quot; area is occasionally transported via this route , as the vehicles , which measure 20 metres in length , would not be able to use the route via the häberles bridge <mask> make the turn on the hauptstrasse .
furthermore , when the hauptstrasse is blocked , the route would also serve as a bypass for those vehicles <mask> not permitted to use the tunnel , argued haas .
given that it is likely that the kirchberg and schlossberg tunnel will have to be reconstructed and renovated <mask> am hirschen &quot; railway crossing may become of major traffic significance for a longer period of time .
the <mask> agreed to have an investigation conducted as to what costs the planned widening of the road would incur .
nevertheless , the reconstruction of the railway crossing was <mask> extend the connecting road in the &quot; bahnhofstraße &quot; direction to around 5.5 metres to accommodate oncoming traffic .
the reconstruction of the railway crossing at the trautwein tannery could , on the other hand , bring with it an <mask> to the steep &quot; geroltzhäuser weg &quot; .
the administrative department had deutsche bahn &apos;s reconstruction plans investigated by the breinlinger engineering office , as they had doubts as to whether the planned connection of <mask> will be straightforward .
the <mask> inclination of the road could result in longer vehicles becoming stuck .
the <mask> , as the authority responsible for road construction , would then bear responsibility for this .
the reconstruction could therefore result in liability <mask> .
because both the transportation of wood and turning are both possible as things <mask> consented to , argued haas .
at this point , the risk of a train collision <mask> the fact that there is a midpoint from which there is a good line of sight , directly alongside the stopping point .
the trains themselves , coming from the central station , must also be sufficiently slowed down <mask> .
according to the councillors , the reconstruction of this railway line was rejected by a majority , as the <mask> completion of the construction work .
the committee considers the reconstruction of the &quot; vor heubach &quot; and &apos; vor kuhbach &quot; railway crossings <mask> , to be unproblematic .
esa makes decision on major space missions <mask> costing billions
distant planets , gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the european space agency must now agree on two major projects that are to <mask> in the coming years .
there were 30 proposals to choose from , five <mask> running .
distant <mask> .
astronomers have already <mask> more than 1,000 planets near other stars .
whether or not life exists on at least some of these , no ##at##-##at## <mask> .
the choice is <mask> gravitational waves ?
or instead conduct research into the <mask> ?
or search <mask> earth and thus perhaps discover extraterrestrial life ?
these are <mask> at the european space agency , esa .
for their &quot; cosmic vision &quot; programme , they are looking for ideas for two major space <mask> , which should greatly advance research .
the budget for &quot; l ##at##-##at## missions &quot; <mask> euro .
the projects are planned to <mask> 2034 .
at the beginning of september , the elite <mask> missions .
30 ideas were up for debate , of which five have now made it onto the short <mask> .
numerous panels are assessing the proposals <mask> questions to the researchers .
over the coming days , a final decision is to be <mask> by the scientific programme committee .
in total , four main questions were chosen by the esa , to which the missions <mask> to find the answers .
what are the conditions required for the formation of <mask> ?
the precise processes for the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus the formation of the planets <mask> .
a <mask> in space could penetrate this darkness .
and if a star has planets , <mask> ?
in <mask> the &quot; cheops &quot; space telescope is to be launched in 2017 , with which 500 known planetary systems in proximity to us will be investigated in greater detail .
the possibilities are , however , limited - cheops is a small mission with a budget of <mask> euro .
with larger instruments , astronomers could map planets similar to earth and even analyse the composition <mask> an indicator for biological activity .
how does the solar <mask> ?
this question should also provide information <mask> preconditions for the origins of life .
the magnetic activity of a star , the interaction of its magnetic field and the emitted particle radiation play an <mask> role .
it is possible to investigate these processes in <mask> elsewhere .
with the &quot; solar orbiter &quot; , the esa has already approved <mask> ( for which the budget stands at around half a million euro ) to address this matter .
the probe is to be launched in <mask> of the sun .
jupiter and its moons are also of <mask> .
they want to find our what role <mask> the solar system .
the esa is planning that the first of the total of three l ##at##-##at## missions of the &quot; cosmic vision &quot; programme will address <mask> .
the &quot; juice &quot; ( jupiter icy moons explorer ) probe is planned to <mask> in 2022 .
eight years later it will reach jupiter <mask> atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons europa , callisto and ganymede .
what are the <mask> the universe ?
outer <mask> conditions and thus examining whether the laws of nature , as known to us , are still valid there .
there may also be deviations that could show physicians the path to a new theory , under the umbrella of <mask> be united .
how did the universe <mask> does it consist of ?
13.7 billion years ago , our cosmos was created by the <mask> .
alongside the materials familiar to us , from which stars , planets and life forms such as ourselves are composed , there exists dark <mask> , the effects of which accelerate the expansion of the universe .
thus far , researchers know neither which physical laws applied in the initial moments after the big bang , nor what <mask> energy consist of .
with &quot; euclid &quot; , the <mask> 2020 .
with a special telescope , the probe is to examine the distribution of material in the <mask> across the entire sky , thus enabling conclusions to be drawn regarding the properties of dark matter and dark energy .
proposals that <mask> ...
of the 30 proposals , only two <mask> the end of the selection procedure .
the proposal with the best chance of approval as an l ##at##-##at## mission , <mask> waves .
many physicians perceive this to entail changes in the structure <mask> ##at##-##at## time , which albert einstein predicted almost 100 years ago .
to date they have <mask> .
the scientists behind the project <mask> achieve this .
the mission involves placing a detector , consisting of two or <mask> outer space .
unlike systems on earth , it could also prove gravitational waves created <mask> cosmos .
four other proposals are still competing for the second l ##at##-##at## mission place : a large x ##at##-##at## ray telescope called &quot; athena &quot; , which among other things would research black holes , &quot; icy planets &quot; , another mission to the <mask> for the measurement of cosmic background radiation , and the &quot; exoplanet finder &quot; , which would find and investigate planets similar to earth .
among others , proposals that have <mask> as proposals in the area of solar physics .
snowden ready to &quot; <mask> &quot; with germany over us surveillance
edward <mask> travel to berlin to give evidence to the german parliament if the us national security agency and its director keith alexander fail to provide answers about its activities .
german mp hans ##at##-##at## christian ströbele on thursday met mr snowden in russia <mask> discuss him testifying in germany .
a letter from mr snowden , presented to the media in berlin on friday by the mp , said <mask> political speech with felony charges that provide no defence . &quot;
however , speaking the truth is not a <mask> .
in the letter , mr <mask> could persuade the us government to abandon criminal charges against him .
the charges <mask> government property .
hans ##at##-##at## peter friedrich , german interior minister <mask> to speak to german officials , we will find ways to make this possible . &quot;
relations between <mask> come under strain following claims that the nsa bugged chancellor angela &apos;s merkel &apos;s phone .
thomas oppermann , the mp who heads the parliamentary panel <mask> said that if there were an opportunity to hear mr snowden as a witness &quot; without bringing him into danger and completely ruining relations with the us , &quot; it should be taken .
mr ströbele , an mp for germany &apos;s green party , published a picture of himself with mr snowden on his <mask> feed .
he was accompanied <mask> journalists .
mr ströbele said that , according to the former nsa contractor <mask> left .
if mr snowden testified in <mask> safe &quot; there , the mp said .
mr snowden said in his letter that he had faced a &quot; severe and sustained &quot; campaign of persecution that forced <mask> home .
however he said that he was heartened by the worldwide <mask> my act of political expression . &quot;
citizens around the world as <mask> as high officials - including in the united states - have judged the revelation of an unaccountable system of pervasive surveillance to be a public service .
the letter extends an offer to cooperate with german authorities &quot; when <mask> this humanitarian situation have been resolved . &quot;
frontier airlines <mask> for carry ##at##-##at## on baggage
frontier airlines plans to charge up to $ 100 for passengers to <mask> their flight .
frontier airlines plans to start charging up to $ 100 for a carry ##at##-##at## on bag and $ 2 for coffee or soda , although its announcement on <mask> say that passengers will get to keep the whole can .
the new carry ##at##-##at## on fee is for bags in the overhead bin , so small bags under <mask> free .
frontier said it will charge $ 25 if the fee is paid <mask> travelers wait to pay until they &apos;re at the gate .
frontier spokeswoman kate o &apos;malley said the $ 100 fee is to get <mask> advance .
&quot; we <mask> she said .
airlines began charging for <mask> bags in 2008 .
passengers trying to avoid those fees have been stuffing as much as they can into carry ##at##-##at## on baggage stashed <mask> overhead bins , meaning those bins often run out of space .

with a <mask> , staring down on them , thousands of people gathered in central maputo to chant peace slogans in a rare public demonstration .
&quot; we want peace back ; we want stability , &quot; said <mask> chief executive of an investment company .
fearful about the future of her country , she swapped her corporate attire for a t ##at##-##at## shirt emblazoned with &quot; <mask> &apos;s independence square on thursday .
for two <mask> , there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and renamo , some of the worst skirmishes since a peace deal more than 20 years ago .
renamo was once a notorious rebel movement , initially backed by white ##at##-##at## ruled <mask> government as part of efforts to destabilise the country &apos;s independent government .

renamo says the government <mask> stronghold , on october 17 .
assaults on the former rebels then escalated as government forces attacked renamo bases and attempted to kill afonso dhlakama , the group &apos;s leader , fernando mazanga , renamo &apos;s spokesman , told <mask> .

both frelimo and renamo insist they want to <mask> .
but concerns have grown after mr mazanga was quoted as saying renamo was abandoning the 1992 <mask> accord .
he told the ft that <mask> frelimo .
&quot; our vision is to come back to negotiations , <mask> .
previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions fuelled by a series of <mask> year .
&quot; it &apos;s two big men ( guebuza and dhlakama ) butting heads together , &quot; said joseph hanlon , a lecturer at <mask> .
neither of them <mask> are prepared to make the kind of concessions that are necessary .

most of the skirmishes have taken place in sofala province , which is several hundred kilometres north of maputo , but <mask> port that miners , including rio tinto and vale , rely on to export coal .
in june , rio suspended its use <mask> .
mr mazanga was coy when asked about whether <mask> repeat this threat .

around 80 participants came to the gemeindehalle ( community hall ) to have the planned <mask> explained to them , to express their concerns and submit ideas .
häußler made clear <mask> members of the town council &quot; .
häußler commented that the flood that found gechingen unprepared on 15 may 2009 , was a decisive event in raising the question of protective measures for the <mask> .
a river basin study was commissioned in collaboration with the neighbouring community of aidlingen <mask> for the flood protection concept in gechingen .
&quot; the <mask> , &quot; said häußler .
the basis for the plans is <mask> which statistically occurs every 100 years , according to the german weather service .
climate change is taken into account in the form <mask> per cent .
in expert circles <mask> .
the masses of water that caused considerable damage in gechingen in 2009 was equivalent to a 1,000 ##at##-##at## <mask> .
&quot; there is no such thing as absolute protection , but we can attempt <mask> &quot; said häußler .
in order to achieve hq 100aklima protection , around four million € must be invested in gechingen , whereby the town can count on a state <mask> .
however , häußler indicated that the funding would only be provided if an overall <mask> .
in order to develop such a concept , the town is <mask> citizens .
a complex planning and approval procedure must be <mask> .
in <mask> in 2016 .
among other measures , the protection concept , which ( we reported ) has already been presented to the town council during the past week , plans local measures in the tributary to the river irm , <mask> stammheim valley .

the police completely blocked off the road <mask> the cause of the accident .
however , they did mention that there were various witness statements that <mask> be assessed .
what is certain is that the 19 ##at##-##at## year ##at##-##at## old female driver of a vw golf was driving in <mask> his hyundai .
the two vehicles collided , whereby the woman was so severely stuck that it took the fire <mask> the vehicle wreckage .

both unfortunate parties were taken to nearby <mask> .

philip k. dick was a god <mask> metaphysician , and to a certain extent his novels and stories also feature recurring themes .
the external likeness is astounding : <mask> the high forehead .
and so , as fyodor m. dostoevsky - with his massive oeuvre - is considered the revealer and apologist of the russian soul , philip k. dick is considered an american prophet , who <mask> highly esteemed within his own native country .
some titles have been released by the heyne verlag publishing house , the &apos; haffman &apos;s cassette &apos; featuring 118 stories was distributed <mask> .
dick illustrates america - the kingdom <mask> been chosen .
dick had <mask> later books read like a mixture of the book of revelation and a computer manual .
perhaps he was crazy , or perhaps drugs had affected his <mask> .
he realised , early on , <mask> are divinities .
he wrote a &apos; theology of the computer &apos; and questioned what separates humans from the machine , the <mask> from the creation .
that is the <mask> runner &quot; problem .

his stories have inspired film producers such as ridley scott , paul <mask> spielberg .
the <mask> significant .

here the principle of the &quot; pre ##at##-##at## crime &quot; is developed , i.e. something that is now more or less official doctrine <mask> .
in dick &apos;s world , which is alarmingly similar to our own , mutants look <mask> police have access to this insight .
&quot; we arrest individuals <mask> government official .
&quot; we get to them first , before they can <mask> &quot; .
and : &quot; in our society we have no major crimes , but we do have a detention camp full of would ##at##-##at## be criminals &quot; . they read <mask> streams .
they assume that bad things are <mask> .
dick &apos;s tale acts as a blueprint for the <mask> and the phone tapping madness of the nsa .
anticipation of attack : this is also how <mask> .
however , dick &apos;s story is <mask> .
the police chief argues that there is no more division of power , the military controls daily life <mask> .

it not only accepts errors and victims , but builds itself on <mask> .

issuing statements regarding the merkel <mask> russia
the former us intelligence expert , edward <mask> may make further statements regarding the us espionage scandal involving federal chancellor , angela merkel , from his russian asylum .
representatives of the german federal prosecutor &apos;s office could either submit questions in writing or meet the 30 ##at##-##at## year <mask> interfax agency .
green party parliament representative , hans ##at##-##at## christian ströbele , was yesterday the first german politician to meet with <mask> to discuss the scandal with him .
nsa <mask> surveillance
on a mild day <mask> buzzed low over the us consulate in frankfurt , the financial capital of germany .
on the instruction of the office for the protection of the constitution ( bfv ) , germany &apos;s domestic intelligence agency , its mission was to photograph the rooftop of the <mask> than 5km from the european central bank and bundesbank .
german media say the bfv hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and the action prompted an exchange between the us and the german <mask> ministry in berlin .
james clapper , us director of national intelligence , <mask> &quot; to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of us companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their bottom line . &quot;
but ever since edward snowden , the contractor turned whistleblower , began releasing his treasure trove of us surveillance secrets , european governments and business leaders are no <mask> his word .
reports <mask> gained access to data held by us cloud providers including google and yahoo have ratcheted corporate paranoia about state surveillance to new highs .
the final straw came when <mask> for about a decade .
if europe &apos;s most powerful person can be targeted , then surely business leaders are also <mask> .
snowden has made transparent <mask> services and companies .
i think it &apos;s conceivable that these <mask> are used for mutual benefit .
&quot; germany must wake up , &quot; says oliver grün , president of bitmi , which represents <mask> .
german companies believe the us now poses almost <mask> industrial espionage and data theft , according to a survey published in july by ey , the consultancy .
in all the documentation leaked by <mask> , been no evidence to date that the us has passed on foreign companies &apos; trade secrets to its own companies .
politicians have expressed concern that the eu lacks <mask> internet capabilities and should strive to reduce its dependence on the us .
business leaders are sceptical about <mask> .

still , the reach and technical sophistication of us spy <mask> the biggest surveillance risk was posed by china .
a big shift is occurring in <mask> more aware that data stored in the us is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable .
according to a survey carried out by the cloud security alliance , a trade body , some 10 per cent of non ##at##-##at## us members cancelled plans to use a us ##at##-##at## based cloud provider after revelations about the <mask> programme .
jim snabe , co ##at##-##at## chief executive at sap , says : &quot; we see a new question from customers that didn &apos;t come up a year ago - which is where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it stays <mask> that jurisdiction . &quot;
many german executives argue that the latest reports are simply confirmation of what they already knew : that powerful states want to steal their most <mask> costs .
that economic spying takes place is not a <mask> .
it has always taken <mask> .
&quot; this has been a topic for <mask> bock , chief executive of chemical maker basf .
the americans spy on us on the commercial and industrial level as we spy on them too , because <mask> our businesses .
corporate leaders are not generally keen to boast about the countermeasures they have <mask> this hands an advantage to an attacker .
for large companies , <mask> that picking up a free usb stick at a trade fair , or leaving a laptop unguarded in a hotel room are unwise , to say the least .
ulrich hackenberg , board member at carmaker audi , says it has been standard practice for years for mobile phones to be collected before board meetings so <mask> be used as remote listening devices .
germany &apos;s bfv advises executives to consider using simple prepaid mobiles when on foreign trips because of the risk that smart phones are <mask> .

it &apos;s <mask> the mystery of why people are gay .
a report filed to the european commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people , as their status is not gender related but instead relates to their biological makeup , which is neither exclusively male nor exclusively female , but <mask> clearly defined as either .
these features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics , such as muscle mass , hair distribution <mask> chromosomal structures and hormones .

children need stability <mask> .
historically , children born with both male and female genitalia were called hermaphrodites , named for the handsome greek god who had <mask> .
and as little as a decade <mask> of gender as a slate that could be erased and then redrawn .
but now , many are challenging the <mask> about their gender assignment when they grow up .
&quot; back in the middle of the 20th century , it was <mask> said drescher .
when these kids were born , you <mask> called a surgeon .
the prevailing theory on how to treat children with ambiguous genitalia was put forward by dr. john money at johns hopkins university , <mask> that gender was malleable .
he coined the term &quot; gender identity &quot; and argued that social and environmental cues -- how parents raised a child -- interacted <mask> as male or female .
but in one <mask> known as &quot; john / joan , &quot; his theories became controversial .
he advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been severed in a botched circumcision to have the child fully castrated , <mask> his testicles , as well , and to raise him as a girl .
&quot; money presented the case as a successful case of transition , but it was not , &quot; <mask> .
when <mask> and married a woman .
but at 38 , he <mask> suicide .
drescher said that now some doctors <mask> that model . &quot;
but in the <mask> advent of the internet , survivors of these gender surgeries have come forward &quot; not happy with the outcome . &quot;
such was the case with jim bruce , a 36 ##at##-##at## year ##at##-##at## old writer from <mask> xy male chromosomes but ambiguous genitals .
doctors couldn &apos;t be sure <mask> a &quot; satisfactory life &quot; as a man .
so shortly after his birth in 1976 , bruce &apos;s external organ and testes were surgically removed and he was raised as a <mask> .
he was given <mask> 12 .
&quot; i knew that <mask> he told abcnews.com .
i <mask> , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
at 18 , he was set <mask> .
but <mask> wrong , he demanded medical records .
what he <mask> horrifying .
i was sterilized at birth -- and <mask> me .
bruce was born with a dsd <mask> prevented his body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop his genitals .
after learning the truth , he changed back to a man , taking <mask> his breasts removed .
surgery rendered <mask> .
today , he advocates for others in an organization called the interface project , trying to normalize perceptions of <mask> who are intersex .
but anne tamar ##at##-##at## mattis , executive director for california ##at##-##at## based legal group advocates for informed choice , worries that <mask> &quot;
&quot; a lot of activists are concerned that what the german <mask> do is encourage parents to make quick decisions and give the child an &apos; undetermined , &apos; &quot; she said .
we are afraid it will encourage <mask> .
we <mask> female sex , then waiting .
but we haven &apos;t seen how the law <mask> .
tamar ##at##-##at## mattis said that her organization <mask> australian law because &quot; it allows adults to choose to be recognized in a third gender . &quot;
&quot; adults should be able to make their own decisions about <mask> she said .
german law is about assigning <mask> .
that is not a battle young children should have to take up at this <mask> .
when they are grown , they can make decisions about <mask> bodies .
but dr. arlene baratz <mask> of sexual development and helps hundreds of others in a support group , said the german law will &quot; empower &quot; both parents and children .
baratz &apos;s daughter <mask> chromosomes , but has a dsd called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome .
because her androgen receptors are faulty <mask> characteristics .
she has a vagina , but no uterus or <mask> .
now at 29 , katie is married and at the university of pennsylvania , a resident <mask> .
though she is <mask> a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy .
&quot; the law gives parents some space not to have to rush into making decisions themselves , <mask> .
it gives them the time to do some tests and figure it out and a period <mask> &apos; female . &apos;
this way , you are ok -- raise the child , <mask> the child .
you have a wonderful <mask> enjoy the fun .
we don &apos;t have to <mask> .
&quot; it brings the children into the decision and takes away the anxiety that motivates parents because they don &apos;t feel they are doing <mask> she said .
ultimately , the child will decide which sex he or she feels more comfortable <mask> and that &apos;s a wonderful thing .
it empowers children to make the decision <mask> .

living with a future ##at##-##at## <mask> perspective
if truth be told , waltraud ries , lives a <mask> .
her house is located in a peaceful neighbourhood in stuttgart , with plenty of greenery , an old <mask> population , nice neighbours and not too much traffic .
she is only a few minutes from the <mask> .
&quot; hopefully you aren &apos;t afraid of spiders ? &quot; asks waltraud ries , pointing out a large spider on the door <mask> .
i have been looking for a new home for my husband <mask> time now .
but you know how difficult that <mask> .
however , the reason for the desire to move is not arachnophobia , but <mask> she explained .
furthermore : since undergoing a meniscus operation , the lady , in her mid ##at##-##at## fifties , has had to experience for herself what it means to move from floor to floor with a <mask> .
only recently , she released a book on the subject of &quot; living happily in old age - which type <mask> me ? &quot; .
&quot; <mask> is the best example of a property that simply doesn &apos;t work in old age , &quot; she begins to recount .
when she moved to the maisonette with her husband 20 years ago , it was simply <mask> green surroundings .
now , in her mid ##at##-##at## <mask> waltraud ries has different thoughts about it .
however , she is aware that she is one of the few people to actually deal with the topic <mask> &apos; .
the majority of people put it to the back of their minds for as <mask> .
only other <mask> old , she says , smirking .
only when the psychological strain becomes severe do <mask> give it consideration .
&quot; but at this stage it can be too <mask> &quot; said ries .
in <mask> 17 housing models for independent living in old age .
&quot; however , which type of residence you <mask> , &quot; she explains .
there is no <mask> age .
even if <mask> take the fact that you may become ill into consideration .
and : &apos; without a sound knowledge of the local language , you can even become lonely when living the dolce vita , &apos; added the author , providing food for <mask> those seeking to move abroad .
her models include classic care models , alternative living arrangements and the often ##at##-##at## mentioned pensioners &apos; <mask> .
in <mask> quirks and ticks .
&apos;however , this type of <mask> wink .
definitely nothing like student <mask> with a shared bathroom and kitchen .
&apos;in old age <mask> space to withdraw to , &apos; said ries .
however , the author does not wish to rule out the possibility <mask> pensioners &apos; residential community can work .
however , it must <mask> differently to the classic student digs .
and sometimes you also just want your peace <mask> &apos; she believes .
with this opinion she is at least not <mask> capital .
the experience of theresa rütten , head of the citizen &apos;s life in old age service <mask> remain in their own homes for as long as possible &apos; .
her agency agency advises people on <mask> of &apos; growing old &apos; .
therefore the experience of <mask> just to be able to remain in their usual environment .
nowadays there are many possibilities for designing <mask> free .
ries recommends that all those working on the age ##at##-##at## appropriate renovation of their house or apartment first seek out in ##at##-##at## depth information and don &apos;t simply <mask> comes along .
nowadays there are specialists in renovation to suit <mask> elderly .
even in the case of rental apartments some landlords can have this <mask> seat , clarified the interior designer .
however , it is not always the case that your existing apartment can be made age ##at##-##at## appropriate and therefore barrier ##at##-##at## free <mask> it is as beautiful as ever .
waltraud ries had to go through this <mask> herself .
you could of course install a stair lift inside the apartment , but <mask> , featuring a number of steps would be a much greater hindrance .
she will keep <mask> she has found the ideal property for herself and her husband .
she <mask> on her front door .

the revelation is the most notable bombshell from <mask> change 2012 . &quot;
the times obtained a <mask> whether the dumping biden could help bolster obama &apos;s waning re ##at##-##at## election hopes .
according to the times &apos; national political correspondent jonathan martin , the book provides a thorough account of the <mask> senior officials inside the campaign and the white house , namely former white house chief of staff bill daley , to measure what effect swapping former secretary of state clinton for the vice president would have in the polls .
the potential switch <mask> and inside the oval office .
only half a dozen of the president &apos;s closest advisers -- including daley , former obama campaign chief jim messina , <mask> under consideration .
&quot; double down &quot; claims daley spearheaded the effort to replace biden , despite their &quot; close personal rapport , &quot; <mask> ultimately deciding against the move when their data showed adding clinton to the ticket wouldn &apos;t &quot; materially improve obama &apos;s odds . &quot;
in an interview with martin , daley <mask> in fact consider replacing biden with clinton .
&quot; i was vocal <mask> , &quot; daley told the paper .
you have to remember , at that point the president <mask> , &quot; holy christ , what do we do ? &quot;
while daley characterized the research as &quot; due diligence , &quot; martin told cnn &apos;s anderson cooper that the re ##at##-##at## <mask> investment in finding out whether the move would pay dividends at the polls .
&quot; campaigns don &apos;t spend the kind of money on polling and focus groups unless they &apos;re seriously considering something , <mask> ac360 .
it &apos;s unclear , <mask> his team was exploring the swap .
martin <mask> asked daley whether his then ##at##-##at## boss knew about the potential shuffle .
while daley said he doesn &apos;t think the president &quot; was aware &quot; of the potential change , the former chief of <mask> &apos;s &quot; possible &quot; obama knew .
martin added that &quot; double down &quot; does not definitively answer <mask> political probing reached obama &apos;s desk .
cooper asked martin whether he seriously thought obama did not know about the <mask> into dumping biden from the ticket .

what happens with my e ##at##-##at## mail when <mask> ?
e ##at##-##at## mail is short <mask> mail .
are there <mask> traditional postal service , implemented into the design of this internet ##at##-##at## based service ?
when designing the <mask> making communication possible .
thus , when developing the underlying technical protocols , no attention was given to creating a stable foundation for the interception <mask> .
for this <mask> than a sealed letter .
when user &quot; anna &quot; sends an email to &quot; benni &quot; , are the pair &apos;s computers then <mask> connected ?
anna &apos;s email program or browser <mask> mail to her service provider &apos;s mail server .
if she has a gmail account , for example , this would be <mask> .
this mail server sends the content to the provider <mask> benni uses .
en route , the mail <mask> through any number of other servers on the internet .
benni <mask> from his provider .
are traditional e ##at##-##at## mails read <mask> net ?
the majority of e ##at##-##at## <mask> read several times by software robots en route to the recipient .
checks are generally carried <mask> as to whether the mail contains malware as an attachment .
a virus check <mask> out on the recipient systems .
in addition , the providers check whether it is nuisance or unwanted spam mail , which <mask> immediately or at least sorted into a spam folder .
do the robots have <mask> tasks ?
in the case of systems such as gmail , the robots also identify the <mask> for displaying context ##at##-##at## based advertising .
if anna and benni communicate about their <mask> holiday travels via gmail , google can display corresponding links to holiday offers .
do unknown individuals also read <mask> mails ?
the probability of unauthorised persons reading <mask> is extremely low .
however , <mask> , it is possible .
within companies , administrators are often <mask> read electronic mail that is sent .
law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal authorisation to intercept or take note of <mask> .
this may include potential <mask> activities .
is it possible to protect <mask> ?
with an encryption using the openpgp standard , an e ##at##-##at## mail can be effectively protected <mask> read .
with great technical effort , it is also possible to conceal the metadata of email communication so <mask> not even possible to tell who is communicating with whom .
how important are yahoo and google within the e ##at##-##at## mail <mask> germany ?
according to a study conducted by convios consulting in august 2013 , among <mask> and google play only a minor role .
while the number of yahoo mail accounts has fallen recently , google &apos;s <mask> grow considerably .

a british entrepreneur has created the world &apos;s first glow ##at##-##at## in ##at##-##at## the ##at##-##at## dark ice cream <mask> jellyfish .
charlie francis has harnessed the fluorescent properties of the marine animal to develop <mask> .
he came up with the idea after <mask> recreate the glowing protein .
the ice cream <mask> - raising the ph level in the protein and making it glow .
chris says because the ice cream lights up when it reacts with the heat of the mouth it <mask> , the brighter it becomes .
charlie , founder of the &quot; lick me i &apos;m delicious &quot; ice cream company , said : &quot; it is incredible stuff but still at very early days in terms of production , so £ 200 <mask> . &quot;
the protein we are using in the ice <mask> neutral ph .
so as your mouth warms up the protein it will raise the ph level and the ice cream <mask> glow .
we have been <mask> perfect to share it over halloween because it gives that wonderful glow effect .
it is probably the most expensive ice cream i have made because the jellyfish luminescence <mask> gold .
so each scoop costs me <mask> .
it tastes pretty good <mask> .
charlie &apos;s experimental company , based in bristol , is <mask> including beer , cheese , beef and gold leaf .
but his next creation is set to be even <mask> ambitious .
he <mask> to develop an invisible ice cream . &quot;
it is inherently impossible <mask> the ice cream , but i reckon we will find a way of doing it .

halloween 2013 : <mask> numbers
when i <mask> halloween was magical .
my sister and i were allowed to eat <mask> up for the neighborhood .
nowadays <mask> more of a scrooge .
i haven &apos;t signed up for the past two years to give out <mask> apartment and probably won &apos;t this year .
but <mask> show that i &apos;m a black sheep when it comes to halloween .
the majority of americans - 158 million of them in fact - will be celebrating halloween this year , spending a total of $ 6.9 billion on candy , costumes and decorations , according to the <mask> retail federation .
one thing i do look forward to every halloween <mask> .
costumes are expected to account for $ 1.2 billion dollars out of <mask> to the nrf .
this year <mask> the rage .
women don &apos;t have to be sexy professionals anymore ; they can also be sexy foods like pizza , hamburgers and <mask> .
as for men , i expect we will be seeing a lot of zombies <mask> year .
according to google , the highest searched costumes are zombies <mask> .
i <mask> traditional .
we dressed our dogs <mask> and to my amazement we were not alone .
in fact <mask> 330 million on pet costumes this year , according to the nrf .
that &apos;s <mask> .
when it comes to candy , we don <mask> .
americans <mask> spend $ 1.9 billion on it this year , according to the nielsen company .
that &apos;s around 600 million pounds worth of hershey bars <mask> clark bars .
that &apos;s great news for the 41 million trick ##at##-##at## or ##at##-##at## treaters set to <mask> the u.s. commerce department .
in fact , we will buy and , who are we kidding , consume 90 million pounds of <mask> during halloween .
the one thing we don &apos;t want to consume , candy corn ; and yet nearly 35 million pounds of it <mask> .
that &apos;s <mask> .
it &apos;s a mystery i have yet <mask> .
nothing is more quintessentially halloween than haunted <mask> .
they have the best names , like &quot; terror behind the walls &quot; ( which , by the way is <mask> &quot; the house of shock . &quot;
in fact , there are 1,200 officially sanctioned haunted houses in the united states generating about $ 500 million in revenue , according to america haunts , and that includes those awesome photos of you mid ##at##-##at## peeing your pants that your friend puts on facebook and you can &apos;t take down and then that guy you like sees the photo and leaves a <mask> nice face . &quot;
finally , let &apos;s <mask> .
charlie brown introduced us to the great pumpkin when we were kids , and carving a jack ##at##-##at## o ##at##-##at## lantern is like decorating a christmas tree - it &apos;s <mask> done since we were little .

this year , americans will spend around $ 106 million on pumpkins , according to the u.s. census <mask> .
the jack ##at##-##at## o ##at##-##at## lantern slowly withering on <mask> came from illinois , which grew 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year .

this comes at the same time as a possible shortage of ministers : the protestant lutheran regional church of hanover calculates that , as things stand , <mask> 1,800 pastors will be halved by 2030 .
for the young people of today , the career is very attractive and offers good future prospects , said <mask> mathis burfien ( 43 ) in a conversation with the protestant press service .
it is attractive to be able to <mask> your own daily working routine .
with burfien <mask> commissioned a minister to work full time , endeavouring to inspire young people to study theology .
at present , <mask> theology after their abitur examinations ( equivalent to a levels ) .
burfien puts this down to the process of secularisation : &quot; god <mask> quiet , the world is loud &quot; .
the job is characterised by great <mask> and variety .
i am the master of my own schedule and can therefore turn <mask> me .
as pastoral workers , ministers can be close to <mask> .
they earn as much as teachers and can <mask> living .

this would suit the <mask> about having a meaningful job as well .

george kerevan : europe break <mask> choice
another <mask> story .
this time we <mask> independent scotland would be required to join the europe ##at##-##at## wide free ##at##-##at## travel zone as a condition of eu membership .
cue stories about passport controls at berwick and a barbed wire border <mask> wall .
true , the strathclyde paper pointed out the possible economic benefits <mask> with the rest of europe , though - predictably - that did not figure in the headlines .
nor did anyone point out that the eu member <mask> it suits them .
since scotland isn &apos;t in the schengen area now , continued non ##at##-##at## compliance <mask> the scots .
so , a non ##at##-##at## story , <mask> .
and one that is so long in the tooth it has become fossilised : i first heard the &quot; independence means passport controls &quot; canard at <mask> .
yet there is <mask> a whiskery old tale .
why should an independent scotland be expected to do <mask> anyway ?
why <mask> london &apos;s yoke for that of brussels , especially now ?
here is the real european news : the great , post ##at##-##at## war plan to unite europe <mask> .
with the <mask> .
across the eu , parties which are dedicated to opposing the eu , or to scrapping <mask> .
even in germany <mask> - came from nowhere to grab nearly five million votes in september &apos;s federal elections , thus effectively knocking the free democrats ( equivalent to our own lib dems ) out of the bundestag .
there has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal <mask> .
however , the current <mask> .
the austerity imposed by berlin and the european central bank , coupled with the straitjacket <mask> .
the crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments running <mask> deficits - that was true only of greece .
rather , the euro system locked in its members at exchange rates favourable <mask> want to keep .
without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation , southern europe finds <mask> a built ##at##-##at## in productivity disadvantage vis ##at##-##at## à ##at##-##at## vis germany .
the only recourse is to slash wages and <mask> - spurred on by berlin .
beyond the current budget and currency problems <mask> malaise .
as a result of &quot; green &quot; energy policies imposed by brussels - code for subsidising french and german energy firms <mask> twice as much for electricity , and four times as much for gas , as in the united states .
that is a crippling cost disadvantage , as we &apos;ve <mask> grangemouth .
all the wage freezes in the world won &apos;t stop the <mask> gas .
as a result , <mask> france , once the eu &apos;s main cheerleader .
after the war , the french political elite saw the eu as a vehicle to keep germany in check , and to give <mask> in the world with washington .
but berlin no longer needs paris as a passport to political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy <mask> , leaving the battered french economy struggling .
result : marine le pen &apos;s right ##at##-##at## wing , anti ##at##-##at## eu national front has just won a crucial by <mask> into third place .
the front is now the most popular party in france with 24 per cent <mask> that they can &apos;t assume a split on the right will automatically favour the left .
what is le pen doing with her newfound popularity among the french white , working <mask> ?
she wants to use next year &apos;s eu elections to create an <mask> anti ##at##-##at## common currency bloc across the european parliament .
if , as <mask> bloc could dominate the european parliament for the first time .
here &apos;s <mask> anti ##at##-##at## eu and anti ##at##-##at## common currency feeling in europe will coalesce to kill the euro .
the eu won &apos;t disappear , <mask> nations &quot; favoured by general de gaulle .
germany and a few of its satellite economies might keep <mask> .
i expect the uk <mask> itself from this project , hoping to cosy up to the us .
however , washington &apos;s growing interest in the pacific suggests britain <mask> .
where <mask> ?
we can choose to <mask> little england .
or we can defend our own economic interests - which includes telling <mask> to get off .
i suspect <mask> well inside a looser european arrangement provided we kept our own currency .
co ##at##-##at## operation with other like ##at##-##at## minded countries will be easier <mask> .
otherwise we should consider emulating norway and <mask> our economic independence .
the snp government in scotland is - remarkably-- the most successful anti ##at##-##at## austerity <mask> spectacular majority in 2011 on the basis of opposing the cuts proposed ( and implemented ) by labour &apos;s chancellor alistair darling and the subsequent tory ##at##-##at## lib dem coalition .
it <mask> to accept austerity imposed by berlin and brussels .
early puberty : growing <mask> sooner
african ##at##-##at## american and hispanic <mask> counterparts , research shows .
physical changes don &apos;t <mask> imminent

experts think the obesity <mask> be one trigger of early puberty
the trend toward early puberty is <mask> boys
former cnn correspondent pat etheridge is a journalist specializing in children <mask> family issues .
should a mother be alarmed if her daughter begins to <mask> ?
at the annual conference of the american academy of pediatrics this week in orlando , florida <mask> and represent a new norm .
&quot; i spend a lot of time <mask> not signal a rapid progression into full puberty , &quot; said kaplowitz .
obvious signs of development , such as budding breasts , pubic <mask> .
but there has been only a slight shift in the age of menarche ( the first period ) over the <mask> decades .
in the united states , the average age is 12.5 <mask> in 1970 .
&quot; once breasts begin to develop , it takes at least two to three years before menarche , &quot; said kaplowitz , also author of <mask> with this common problem . &quot;
time is the most accurate test of how puberty is going to <mask> .
there is debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty , but it is considered &quot; precocious &quot; <mask> growth spurt before age 8 .
in most cases , the process will slow down or stall -- <mask> closely .
a more rapid progression may warrant tests by an endocrinologist to rule out <mask> cysts .
there are treatments <mask> to stunted growth and being short as an adult .
recommendations for drug or hormone therapy are based on the child &apos;s age , <mask> maturity .
psychosocial aspects <mask> , too .
kaplowitz is cautious with medication but acknowledges , &quot; suppressing puberty may alleviate behavioral issues and girls &apos; feelings of <mask> from peers . &quot;
the other big issue is understandable : parents simply <mask> periods .
&quot; they worry about the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene , &quot; said <mask> .
&quot; it was a shock , &quot; recalls one <mask> at 10 .
even though there were <mask> emotionally prepared .
she came <mask> and upset to be the first among her friends .
there are lots of well ##at##-##at## publicized theories about the causes of precocious <mask> .
yet , <mask> no consistent body of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are to blame .
boys - like girls - <mask> puberty earlier .
kaplowitz contends the premise that holds the most weight is the <mask> of obesity .
he helped conduct a 2001 study of 6- to 9 ##at##-##at## year ##at##-##at## old girls <mask> timing of puberty .
other findings <mask> factors .
in this country , african ##at##-##at## american and hispanic girls tend to <mask> earlier than their white counterparts .

globally , patterns of early puberty appear <mask> everything from economic conditions to climate to genes .
another conundrum : although boys are getting facial and pubic hair <mask> .
other doctors attending the aap conference reinforced <mask> the topic .
the appearance of acne and pubic hair is <mask> toddlers .
&quot; we need to <mask> of puberty , &quot; said dr. lawrence silverman , a pediatric endocrinologist at goryeb children &apos;s hospital in morristown , new jersey .
parents should not <mask> their pediatrician about how to talk with their child .
&quot; it may mean having a sooner ##at##-##at## than ##at##-##at## <mask> &quot; kaplowitz advised .

jet makers <mask> over seat width with big orders at stake
a row has flared up between leading plane makers over the width of tourist ##at##-##at## class seats on long ##at##-##at## <mask> setting the tone for a bitter confrontation at this month &apos;s dubai airshow .
the dispute focuses on the width of seats provided on long ##at##-##at## haul flights for economy passengers - not always the <mask> allocated space holds the key to efficiency claims for the latest jets offered by airbus sas and boeing co .
airbus this week called for an industry standard that would provide for a seat at least 18 inches ( 46 cm ) wide in economy cabins , but its u.s. arch ##at##-##at## rival boeing says it should be for airlines to <mask> .
the dispute comes as plane makers vie to sell ever ##at##-##at## larger versions of their twin ##at##-##at## engined long ##at##-##at## distance aircraft , <mask> .
how the back of the plane is laid out - particularly whether seating is 9 or 10 abreast - is central <mask> &quot; mini ##at##-##at## jumbo &quot; jet designs .
boeing says its revamped &quot; 777x &quot; will <mask> based on economy seats more than 17 inches wide and set out 10 in each row .
airbus says the competing version of its a350 will carry 350 people in 18 ##at##-##at## inch ##at##-##at## <mask> .
plane giants often trade blows <mask> press .
now , airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the dubai airshow , where the 777x is expected to dominate with more <mask> .
it recently previewed what may be the start of a new ad war by showing financiers a slide illustrating three people squashed <mask> you accept this ? &quot;
&quot; boeing is proposing long ##at##-##at## distance flying in seats narrower than regional turbo ##at##-##at## props , &quot; said <mask> john leahy .
as diets change , people get bigger but plane seating has not radically <mask> .
between the early 1970s , when the boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long ##at##-##at## haul travel , and the <mask> cent , according to u.s. health department data .
the waist of the average 21st ##at##-##at## century american male is 39.7 inches , according to u.s. health <mask> .
airbus says its rival <mask> of the newly christened &quot; jet set &quot; was narrower .
airbus says it has commissioned research <mask> seat width improves sleep quality by 53 per cent .
boeing disputes airbus &apos;s figures on seat measurements and <mask> step into decisions on how airlines balance fares and facilities .
it also says research shows cabin <mask> width of a seat .
&quot; it really comes down to providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do the things that they believe they need to do to be successful , &quot; said boeing cabins <mask> kent craver .
they don &apos;t want us to dictate <mask> them profitable .
they know their business <mask> .
for flyers it <mask> elbow room , but for suppliers it is increasingly an issue that could affect earnings .
behind the dispute is a race for plane orders with at least $ 700 ##at##-##at## billion of estimated business at list prices in coming decades , enough to tip the scales of u.s. <mask> exports .
as reuters first reported in july , seat layout <mask> the latest jets .
both airbus and boeing <mask> per cent better efficiency per seat in their latest twin ##at##-##at## engined long ##at##-##at## haul designs than the market leader in that segment , the 365 ##at##-##at## seat boeing 777 ##at##-##at## 300er .
boeing &apos;s performance claims depend in part on comparing the 10 ##at##-##at## abreast 777x <mask> 9 ##at##-##at## abreast 777 design .
the <mask> 10 ##at##-##at## abreast now in use .
&quot; the reason boeing are doing this is to cram more seats <mask> .
on the other hand , analysts say full 10 ##at##-##at## seat ##at##-##at## per ##at##-##at## row cabins for existing 777s <mask> may go hand in hand with cheaper fares .
&quot; eighteen inches in seat width would be great for passengers , but the reality is that from a business point of the airbus proposal is driven by the threat of the 777 , &quot; said cabin interiors expert mary kirby , founder and editor of the <mask> network .
airbus and boeing do not supply seats but offer a <mask> from .
globe ##at##-##at## <mask> competing layouts .
while boasting comfort , all builders also offer jets <mask> cost airlines and regional travel .
airbus offers a 10 ##at##-##at## <mask> yet sold it .
until recently , airbus was stressing the need for more cabin customization by offering wider <mask> jets .
without the support of the only other maker of large modern jets , experts say its call for a new <mask> could distract from a wave of 777x sales .
new <mask> nicotine vaccine could take the pleasure out of smoking
scientists have developed an anti ##at##-##at## nicotine <mask> pleasure out of smoking a cigarette .
a single dose of <mask> was able to protect mice against nicotine addiction for life .
further tests are needed before starting human trials , which would take <mask> medical college in new york said the early signs are good .
&quot; we are very hopeful that this kind of vaccine strategy <mask> smokers who have tried to stop , exhausting all the methods on the market today , but find their nicotine addiction to be strong enough to overcome these current approaches , &quot; prof cornell said .
the <mask> virus that has been engineered to carry the genetic information to make anti ##at##-##at## nicotine antibodies .
the virus selectively infects liver cells , which then start to <mask> a steady stream of the antibodies .
the antibodies hunt down any nicotine molecules in the bloodstream , neutralising <mask> getting a nicotine hit .
in tests , vaccinated mice who were <mask> their normal activity .
but mice who had <mask> , a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains .
the experiments are described in the <mask> translational medicine .
previous tobacco vaccines failed because <mask> antibodies .
the jabs had to be given so frequently to keep antibody levels <mask> impractical .
but the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be far lower , because it <mask> factories .
prof crystal said that if a future human <mask> a cigarette , preventing nicotine addiction .
but <mask> be used by smokers to quit .
&quot; they will know if they start smoking again , they will receive no pleasure from it due to the nicotine vaccine , and <mask> habit , &quot; he said .
british scientists said the results were interesting but warned far more research <mask> .

aircraft electronic device <mask> in australia for now
australian airline passengers will need to continue turning off their tablets and smart phones during take <mask> moves in the us to loosen regulations covering the devices .
the us federal aviation administration has <mask> e ##at##-##at## books , watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight provided they remain in &quot; airplane &quot; mode .
passengers can already do this during the bulk of a flight but many people find it annoying to be unable to access their e ##at##-##at## books <mask> and landings .
australian carriers are looking at the decision , which requires us carriers <mask> to meet the requirements , but have indicated they have no immediate plans to change their procedures .
the civil aviation safety authority also said it was looking at the announcement but emphasised <mask> of electronic devices in critical phases of flight were still in place in australia .
&quot; casa currently has <mask> governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft , &quot; it said .
the issue <mask> require aircraft operators to ensure safety is maintained at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members .
virgin , <mask> in ##at##-##at## flight wi ##at##-##at## fi entertainment system , was amenable to a change but said it would take its lead from the regulator .
&quot; we would welcome a review by casa into allowing the use of electronic devices because <mask> think it will improve the customer experience now that we have ( wireless in ##at##-##at## flight entertainment ) on our planes , &quot; a spokesman said .
qantas <mask> rules for now .
&quot; our current <mask> to change that , &quot; it said .
the <mask> .
however , we are always interested in regulatory developments <mask> decision and the reasons behind it .
for us carriers , the impact of the ruling will vary from airline to airline and will <mask> the age of their fleet .
carriers will need to prove their planes can tolerate radio interference from <mask> training materials , carry ##at##-##at## on baggage programs and passenger briefings .
&quot; once an airline verifies the tolerance of its fleet , it <mask> at all altitudes , &quot; the faa said .
in rare instances of low visibility , the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during <mask> .

travelling bvb fans created terrible scenes with flares in the <mask> before the district derby against schalke
borussia dortmund announced that there <mask> be serious consequences .
before friday &apos;s bundesliga match against vfb stuttgart , <mask> initially .
it was an unusual , almost ghostly atmosphere that the fans created until shortly before the kick ##at##-##at## off of the bundesliga <mask> runners ##at##-##at## up borussia dortmend and vfb stuttgart , in the signal iduna park .
it was mainly the chants of <mask> fans that could be heard .
the south stand , on the other hand , where the most loyal - and the loudest - <mask> was initially unusually quiet : no singing and no battle cries .
the &apos; capo &apos;s &apos; podium , the individual who usually coordinates the unison chants , <mask> .
and right at the front , on the stand , a single large flag with <mask> &quot; stadium ban section &quot; blew in the wind .
only when goalkeeper , roman weidenfeller , was the <mask> the field , did cheers briefly erupt , as is usually the case .
when his <mask> scarves were waving - but by no means everywhere .
in the central blocks of <mask> .
even stadium announcer , norbert dickel , speaking once again of the successful results in recent days - the derby victory <mask> .
just five minutes before kick ##at##-##at## off , the capo climbed onto his podium - and the tension that had been almost tangible up until that point , lifted with a large shout , as dickel asked for a shout from each section of <mask> .
as <mask> finally the stand resumed its usual role as the loudest section of the stadium .
and as soon as the vociferous request for &quot; derby winners stand up &quot; came from the south <mask> , everything was back to normal .
the previous silence was indeed a reaction <mask> of previous days .
immediately before the local district derby against fc schalke 04 , some of the travelling bvb fans fired flares into the crowds of spectators and onto <mask> and in so doing almost hit goalkeeper roman weidenfeller .
the kick ##at##-##at## off was delayed on <mask> ,
as a result , bvb chairman hans joachim watzke had invited the <mask> to his office - and if watzke &apos;s words are to be believed , this was a rather uncomfortable meeting for the fan representatives .
&quot; there will be massive impact for the entire ultra movement , &quot; announced the <mask> discussion in frankfurt .
as an immediate measure , watzke prohibited the ultras from organising choreography for the home match <mask> .
&quot; i have <mask> he explained .
we <mask> ignore the zero tolerance policy regarding pyrotechnics in saxony .
in addition , the ultras were given the option of <mask> - they now have until tuesday to decide which one to accept .
otherwise <mask> , said watzke .

it will be interesting to see the reactions in the south <mask> .

even though she earns s $ 3,000 ( $ 2,400 ) a month as an administrator and her husband works as well <mask> insufficient , she says .
indeed , such is demand across parts of southeast asia - where household debt is rising - that valuemax , where she is <mask> the third pawnshop to list on the singapore stock exchange .
pawning <mask> cash - s $ 1,300 in ms amirthalinga &apos;s case - but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans .
typically pawnbrokers in singapore charge an effective annual percentage rate of 17 per cent , just above the 15.4 per cent offered at united overseas bank , a local lender with a branch in <mask> centre .
however , <mask> advantage of not requiring credit checks or proof of salary , and can arrange loans faster than banks .
hence millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops as families feel the squeeze from rising living costs and ballooning <mask> and consumer debt .
after five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis , and cheap credit fuelled by loose monetary policy in advanced economies , lower- and middle ##at##-##at## income families are <mask> pawn shops to make up the difference as their economies slow .

such is the growth in the pawn business that valuemax , operator of the outlet at bendemeer and of 15 others like it in singapore , plans <mask> in neighbouring malaysia - where it has four shops - but outside asia too , says yeah lee ching , valuemax &apos;s executive director .
the company will fund that <mask> raised this week in a listing on the singapore stock exchange .

$ 325m <mask> package for tassie health
the federal government insists a $ 325 million rescue package for tasmania &apos;s ailing health system has tough conditions attached that will ensure the state <mask> waste the funds .
federal health minister tanya plibersek has announced the commonwealth is taking &quot; urgent action &quot; to head off a crisis caused by the island <mask> of chronic disease and system constraints .
the funding , over four years , was <mask> government consultations with tasmanian independent mp andrew wilkie .
&quot; the government has come up with an emergency rescue package we believe will address the unique <mask> state , &quot; ms plibersek said today .
the $ 325 <mask> $ 31 million elective surgery blitz .
an additional <mask> and cataract surgery will help clear a backlog .
there &apos;s also money for walk ##at##-##at## in clinics in hobart and launceston , better after ##at##-##at## hospital care , medical specialist training , mental health services and <mask> personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals .
&quot; these investments respond to the ideas that front ##at##-##at## line clinicians have told me will be the best ways to tend to tasmania <mask> .
the minister insisted the <mask> face a strict reporting and accountability regime .
the state would have to maintain <mask> monthly on where it was spending the extra funds .
a three ##at##-##at## person commission will be set up to ensure the state is delivering services as effectively <mask> possible .
mr wilkie today said the $ 325 million would count for little &quot; unless it &apos;s followed by genuine reform to put tasmania &apos;s public health system <mask> sustainable footing . &quot;
he nevertheless praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance which he <mask> the beginning of may .
&quot; i &apos;m hopeful the federal assistance package will go a long way <mask> mr wilkie said .
according to the state government <mask> recent cuts .
but federal opposition health spokesman peter <mask> . &quot;
&quot; the reason we are here is that the labor state government ripped $ 430 million out of its health system , <mask> abc tv .
you can &apos;t have a state government ripping out almost half ##at##-##at## a ##at##-##at## billion dollars and the commonwealth put in <mask> day .
mr dutton called on ms <mask> on additional bureaucracy .
guillaume nicloux &apos;s adaptation of denis diderot &apos;s novel boasts exceptional production design and period detail but is also heavier going than it <mask> be .
unfolding in 1760s france , it tells the grim story of suzanne , a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her <mask> .
when she rebels , she experiences extreme cruelty at the hands of a wantonly sadistic mother superior and becomes an object <mask> fascination for another .
the film <mask> or sensationalism - and that &apos;s the problem .
the earnest solemnity of the storytelling risks making it <mask> too .

survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 bali bombing have reacted with anger over the sentence given to the last of the plotters to face justice , saying umar patek should face <mask> squad .
patek , who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of south ##at##-##at## east asia &apos;s most wanted , was yesterday sentenced to 20 <mask> the explosive devices used in the bombing .
he could be released <mask> if granted parole .
the 45 ##at##-##at## year ##at##-##at## old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of kuta <mask> australians , and injured scores more .
he was also found guilty of a number of other terrorism ##at##-##at## related charges , including a wave of bombings of <mask> across indonesia on christmas eve in 2000 .
prosecutors had demanded a life sentence , although they could have pushed that the man dubbed the &quot; demolition man &quot; for his reputation as a master bomb ##at##-##at## maker be sentenced to <mask> .
the decision has reignited painful memories for perth mother june corteen , who lost her 39 ##at##-##at## year ##at##-##at## old twin daughters jane and jenny in the destruction unleashed by patek and his co ##at##-##at## conspirators almost <mask> ago .

he lapsed into a month ##at##-##at## long coma in the wake of the bombing , and &quot; <mask> three times while on life support .
mr hughes said patek should have shared the same fate as three other members of the jemaah islamiah terror cell responsible for the carnage - amrozi <mask> were executed four years ago .
really , this guy <mask> death penalty before anybody .
to keep him alive , well , there &apos;s no reason to <mask> .
to get 20 years , after killing <mask> hundreds , it &apos;s not much .
patek is the last of <mask> bombers to face justice .

faa : air passengers can now use gadgets on planes ( but not make cell <mask> calls )
airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices gate ##at##-##at## to ##at##-##at## gate to read , work , play games , watch movies and listen to music - but not talk on their cellphones - under much ##at##-##at## anticipated new guidelines issued thursday <mask> administration .
but passengers shouldn &apos;t expect <mask> happen immediately .
how <mask> faa administrator michael huerta said at a news conference .
airlines will have to show the faa how their <mask> manuals and rules for stowing devices to reflect the new guidelines .
the faa said it has already received <mask> use of portable electronic devices on planes .
delta and jetblue <mask> submitted plans .
&quot; depending on the condition of the plan , we could approve expanded <mask> soon , &quot; the faa said in a statement .
currently , passengers are required to turn off their smartphones , <mask> and other devices once a plane &apos;s door closes .
they &apos;re not supposed to restart them until the planes <mask> the go ##at##-##at## ahead .
passengers are supposed to turn their devices off again as the plane descends to land and <mask> them until the plane is on the ground .
under the new guidelines , airlines whose planes are properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use the <mask> takeoffs , landings and taxiing , the faa said .
most new airliners and other <mask> use wifi at higher altitudes are expected to meet the criteria .
laura glading , president of the <mask> , welcomed the changes .
&quot; once the new policy is safely implemented - and we &apos;re going to work closely with the carrier to do that - it will be a win ##at##-##at## win , <mask> said in a statement .
we &apos;re frankly <mask> &apos; hall monitors &apos; when it comes to this issue .

faa <mask> ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing
last month , national transportation safety board mark rosenker , a cbs news <mask> that cell phones are still considered a risk .
&quot; cell phones , that really is an issue , not just because potentially it <mask> , &quot; rosenker said .
an industry advisory committee created by the faa to examine the issue recommended last month that the government permit greater use <mask> electronic devices .
pressure has <mask> to ease restrictions on their use .
critics such as sen. claire mccaskill , <mask> .
the restrictions <mask> increasingly difficult to enforce as use of the devices has become ubiquitous .
some <mask> third of passengers forget or ignore directions to turn off their devices .
the faa began restricting passengers &apos; use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to <mask> passengers began carrying fm radios , the high ##at##-##at## tech gadgets of their day .
new airliners are far more reliant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed and approved by the faa to be <mask> interference .
airlines have been offering wi ##at##-##at## fi use at <mask> .
planes modified for wi ##at##-##at## fi systems are <mask> interference .
the vast majority of airliners should qualify for greater electronic device <mask> huerta said .
today &apos;s electronic devices generally <mask> previous generations of devices .
e ##at##-##at## readers , for example , emit only minimal transmissions when turning a <mask> .
but transmissions are stronger when devices are downloading or <mask> data .
among those pressing for a relaxation of restrictions on passengers &apos; use <mask> has been amazon.com .
in 2011 , company officials loaded an airliner full of their kindle e ##at##-##at## readers and flew it around to test for problems but found <mask> .
faa advisory committee members expressed mixed feelings about whether <mask> presents any risk .
douglas kidd of the national association of airline passengers said he believes interference from the devices is <mask> the risk is minimal .
other committee members said there are only anecdotal reports from pilots to support that the devices can interfere with aircraft systems , and most of <mask> reports are very old .
however , the committee recommended the faa allow pilots to order passengers to shut off devices <mask> .

there was general discontent with the single market , with businesses saying that the costs of brussels regulation now outweighed the benefits of being part of europe &apos;s trading area <mask> agreed .

two <mask> charged with sex offences before allegations against jonathan lord , royal commission hears
two ymca nsw <mask> offences before allegations were raised against caringbah child care worker jonathan lord in 2011 , the child sexual abuse royal commission has heard .
but in its opening statement to the commission <mask> had &quot; never dealt with an incident of child sexual assault within its organisation , &quot; the commission was told .
chief executive officer phillip hare was asked about one case where a ymca employee <mask> sexual offences against children in his care in 1991 .
mr hare told gail furness , counsel assisting the commission <mask> .
he conceded the ymca &apos;s opening statement to the commission was also inaccurate in claiming &quot; <mask> child safety . &quot;
evidence before the commission is that ymca was notified that it received the second lowest of four possible ratings in a department of education and communities quality <mask> this year .

earlier this year lord was convicted for sexual offences against 12 boys during the <mask> the ymca .
he was jailed for a <mask> .
but mr hare rejected the suggestion the ymca had a cultural problem which prevented staff from reporting lord <mask> child safety .
staff gave evidence they observed breaches including lord <mask> , babysitting them privately , having them sit on his lap , saying he loved one and letting them play with his mobile phone .
danielle ockwell , who was supervised by lord and asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour , testified she <mask> very intimidating and hard to approach a lot of the time . &quot;
the ceo said he did not accept staff &apos;s evidence that they were uncomfortable with reporting upwards to <mask> managers .
rather , he <mask> their friendships with lord clouded their judgements about reporting him .
mr hare said he had provided his view to the ymca nsw board that the lesson for the <mask> and the board agreed with him .
mr hare said the decision to get staff to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the allegations emerged was made by <mask> manager of children &apos;s services liam whitley .
he said it was intended to avoid contamination of evidence but was &quot; <mask> executed .
ymca nsw was not a child safe organisation at the time jonathan lord was employed between 2009 and 2011 , child sex abuse <mask> griffith university told the commission .
he said there were &quot; serious problems <mask> , induction , training and supervision of staff .

according to dictionaries , <mask> ##at##-##at## category of vegetarianism , yet the two do differ considerably .
for while vegetarians allow themselves to consume cream tarts , ice cream or a strong edam , these indulgences <mask> .
milk , cheese , egg - alongside avoiding meat and fish , vegans <mask> products of animal origin - even honey is not permitted .
you might ask what is left , however , upon closer inspection the world of vegan nutrition is <mask> .
&quot; spreads are very popular , &quot; explained ute henkelmann the owner <mask> which provides a host of special products for vegans .
reuben proctor also likes to <mask> &quot; domgasse &quot; .
the new zealander has been vegan for 13 years , and in lampertheim he can find ( almost ) everything that he needs <mask> diet and became a vegetarian &quot; .
at the turn of the <mask> next step and became vegan .
&quot; however , it wasn &apos;t just the diet that convinced <mask> said proctor , who prefers artificial leather over normal leather .
he realised that you can also overcome all other <mask> animal products .
first and foremost , being vegan <mask> of ethics .
&quot; i don &apos;t want animals to have to die for <mask> of vegans , which applies to all their consumer behaviour .
rather than missing burgers , scrambled eggs or gummi bears , <mask> really inspire him .
&quot; it is a double bonus , &quot; says proctor now , &quot; in actual fact being vegan is not about <mask> that when you convert your diet you are reducing your choice of meal options , proctor puts this down to force of habit .
and it is precisely <mask> failing .
&quot; the temptation factor is a decisive factor in causing many to quickly give up , similar to with smoking , &quot; says proctor , providing a <mask> .
and he argues : <mask> linked to animal produce &quot; .
often it is the herbs or the <mask> the flavour .
&quot; you can , however , create the same effect in <mask> &quot; explains the vegan .
for example , when attending a barbecue party , proctor brings aubergines , mushrooms and <mask> few vegan sausages .
he ensures <mask> whereby everything should also have a good hearty flavour .
of course you want to <mask> bit of bite , that is fair enough .
&quot; <mask> tasty , but this doesn &apos;t necessarily mean animal ##at##-##at## based food , &quot; said proctor .
he has not suffered any damage to his health or eating <mask> .
converting has had a positive <mask> .
i do not consume any foreign cholesterol <mask> my vitamin intake .
there are top athletes who also <mask> vegan diet .
&quot; my blood values are excellent - i have myself checked on a regular basis , &quot; revealed <mask> .
many critics of veganism <mask> the lack of vitamin b12 .
&quot; because animals are fed on fodder instead of grazing , it is dubious whether the vitamin b12 content in meat <mask> &quot; commented proctor .
for vegans there is also the option of taking the co ##at##-##at## enzyme in <mask> tablets .
&quot; my b12 values are fine <mask> .
proctor does <mask> to buy food .
there are basic foodstuffs available <mask> other products .
i can <mask> locally .
i only purchase special items now <mask> .
&quot; many people overlook the fact that even though <mask> that this is also the case for &quot; normal &quot; ready ##at##-##at## made products .
in any case , the preparation <mask> time consuming than commonly assumed .
&quot; in home cooking , there <mask> sometimes better results , &quot; said proctor .
margarine in place of butter , a little more baking powder and bicarbonate of soda in place of egg - proctor has even managed to astonish his in ##at##-##at## laws with <mask> .
the vegan adds new spice to <mask> .
when you <mask> certain dynamic - cooking takes on new value .
&quot; the <mask> may arise are as varied as the people themselves , &quot; said proctor .
of course he has already <mask> scepticism .
do you not like <mask> ?
&quot; should i feel bad now because i drink milk ? &quot; - as a <mask> in such matters .
&quot; i do not disapprove of people , i am part of <mask> explaining that he was not choosing a life of isolation .
and <mask> quite as limited in their everyday lives as is commonly assumed .
fast food is also <mask> .
chips are available <mask> !
&quot; many doner kebab houses offer falafel , or even vegetarian <mask> proctor .
in a pizzeria he avoids pasta dishes or just orders a <mask> habit .
restaurants are slowly adapting to <mask> .
&quot; when i began eating a vegan diet 13 years ago , things were even <mask> says the new zealander , and he points out : &quot; you have to talk with people , make them aware &quot; .
&quot; if enough requests are made , they will <mask> &quot; he hopes .
there are vegan restaurants opening up , such as the kombüse in mannheim or café <mask> .
proctor hopes that other restaurants <mask> vegan dish on the menu .
essentially , vegan dishes are <mask> .
anyone can eat them <mask> opposite of exclusive .
&quot; meat dishes , on the <mask> , as they rule others out , &quot; assessed proctor .
&quot; if you want to avoid food scandals , veganism is a safe way to rule out <mask> .
however , purchasing vegan products can be difficult to <mask> with .
oince you come to understand that peanuts , in particular , may also contain animal additives as a colourant , people seem to <mask> many hurdles and pitfalls .
therefore , for this <mask> ingredients and their alternatives ) explains the many ingredients hidden in both foodstuffs and cleaning agents .
&quot; you gradually develop an internal scanner and you <mask> which symbols and logos you have to look out for &quot; . proctor has learned that &quot; it is sometimes better too take small steps rather than to stand still or stumble &quot; .
veganism is an important moral compass , which has an effect <mask> consciousness .
perhaps he won &apos;t manage to help you break old habits altogether , <mask> question their habits .

prices in central london continued to show steady year ##at##-##at## <mask> a burgeoning &quot; domestic market &quot; with the city &apos;s south west , north ( 7.4 % ) and east ( 6.5 % ) all experiencing an uptick , according to research from savills .
scientists have shed more light on how the movements of a dog &apos;s tail are <mask> mood .
earlier research had revealed that happy dogs wag their tails more to the right ( from the dog &apos;s point of view ) , while nervous dogs have a left <mask> swish .
but now scientists say that fellow canines can spot <mask> .
prof georgio vallortigara , a neuroscientist from the university of trento , said : &quot; it is very well known in humans <mask> of the brain are differently involved in stimuli that invokes positive or negative emotions . &quot;
here we attempted to <mask> in other species .
he added that just as in humans , for dogs the right side of the brain was <mask> hemispheres played different roles in emotions .
to find out more about how dogs react to the lop ##at##-##at## sided tail wags of other dogs , the researchers monitored the animals as they watched <mask> .
they measured the pets &apos; heart rates and analysed their <mask> .
it will probably not be long before we <mask> other
prof vallortigara said : &quot; we presented dogs with movies of <mask> other confounding issues , and we could doctor the movement of the tail and present the tail more to the left or right . &quot;
when the animals saw an otherwise expressionless dog move its tail to the right <mask> tail ##at##-##at## wagging dog &apos;s point of view ) , they stayed perfectly relaxed .
but when they spotted a tail veer predominantly to the left ( <mask> &apos;s point of view ) , their heart rates picked up and they looked anxious .
prof vallortigara said he didn &apos;t think that the dogs were intentionally communicating with each other <mask> .
instead , he believes <mask> learned from experience what moves they should and shouldn &apos;t feel worried about .
he said : &quot; if you have several meetings with other dogs , and frequently their tail wagging one way is associated with a more friendly behaviour , and the right side is <mask> less friendly behaviour , you respond on the basis of that experience . &quot;
the researchers say the findings could give owners <mask> emotions .
dog behaviour expert john bradshaw , a visiting fellow at the university of bristol &apos;s school of veterinary science , said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right <mask> canines .
last year a team <mask> an aggressive dog and to the right when looking at a happy dog .
and in another research paper from the university of victoria in canada , he said : &quot; dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when its &apos; tail &apos; was made <mask> rather than right , rather than becoming anxious - the opposite way around to the italian study . &quot;
he said the differences could be because the dogs in the different studies <mask> as canines .
a study of how dogs responded to real dogs could <mask> , he explained .
&quot; while there is considerable evidence from many different mammals that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes , much of the detail still <mask> .

jack valero of catholic voices said that by february , the <mask> dropped .
he said usually a pope would name as many cardinals <mask> as he wanted .
next year &apos;s consistory would be significant because it would be <mask> , valero said .
at the moment there is a <mask> italy .
&quot; it will be interesting to see whether the new pope will nominate cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance , &quot; he <mask> .
forty percent of roman catholics are in south america , but they have <mask> number of cardinals .
the cardinals will also be the first <mask> cardinals , a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with looking into ways to reform the church .

an obama <mask> of despair
i voted for <mask> of change
he <mask> thwarted by gop obstructionism
obstructionism can &apos;t <mask> website woes , drone attacks
obama &apos;s 2008 campaign memoir is a sad reminder of what might <mask> been
nathaniel p. morris is a second ##at##-##at## <mask> .
i &apos;m reading a terribly sad <mask> days .
it &apos;s a book that i thought would uplift me during the doldrums <mask> a sense of hope .
it &apos;s called &quot; the audacity to win <mask> of barack obama &apos;s 2008 presidential campaign .
when i &apos;m finished with my patient write ##at##-##at## ups <mask> and speeches could take your breath away .
the election turned out to be a landslide , <mask> the hour .
my classmates cried with joy , and my parents saved every <mask> .
a young team of visionaries was headed <mask> and the nation was ready for change .
during obama &apos;s <mask> 2008 , he had an 82 % approval rating .
and then i <mask> .
cutting to the <mask> out of a dream .
it &apos;s hard to remember those days of optimism -- they seem <mask> by .
change indeed happened , in the years <mask> first ballot .
it was simply <mask> i could have imagined .
i credit obama with great and varied accomplishments , <mask> &apos;t tell , &quot; to the killing of osama bin laden .
moreover , i believe that partisan obstructionism has upended too many efforts to push our nation forward : immigration reform <mask> care , and closing the base at guantanamo bay , among others .
but , <mask> reached a limit to the explanations that i can provide .
i &apos;ve reached a point of political <mask> .
republican obstructionism cannot explain allowing <mask> nor having drones strike innocent children overseas .
it cannot explain having the national security agency collect data on the private lives of americans , nor prosecuting <mask> .
it cannot account for assassinating anwar al ##at##-##at## awlaki , an american citizen , without a trial , nor shirking public funding and spending limits <mask> campaigns .
it cannot <mask> of a report that says the white house &apos;s efforts to silence the media are the &quot; most aggressive ... since the nixon administration . &quot;
and , most recently , it cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website more than three years since the affordable care <mask> .
i don &apos;t know if this <mask> have expected .
if , at 18 years old , i was supposed to figure out that governance may contradict the <mask> .
obviously , elective office isn &apos;t a predictable course , as the <mask> will shape our public conversation .
yet , of all of the examples <mask> seem to be of the administration &apos;s own choosing .
that <mask> most of all .
i voted for obama again in <mask> by his candidacy .
mitt romney presented a confusing and unrefined alternative who could not seem to lock down his policies or his <mask> .
i felt that a second term for obama , free from the pressures of future elections , would fulfill the hope <mask> had heard of for so long .
still <mask> to 2008 through that book has become that much harder .
it makes me <mask> promises that disappeared .
this week <mask> how obama suffered a huge loss to clinton in the pennsylvania primary .
at a post ##at##-##at## mortem campaign meeting , he told his staff that they needed to get back on track and stay true to the purpose of their <mask> .
&quot; i want us to get our mojo <mask> said .
we &apos;ve got to <mask> are . &apos;
it &apos;s five years later , mr. president , and i couldn &apos;t agree with you <mask> .

what is wrong <mask> continually throw their fast food bags out of the car window ? !
at the weekend in particular , discarded paper <mask> can be found at the side of the road and in car parks .
&quot; why is this ? &quot; i ask <mask> .
are the people too stupid to take their bags home or throw them <mask> rubbish bin ?
after all , waste paper does <mask> spoil the landscape .
bags have also been seen covering transport facilities such <mask> , thus causing accidents .
however , the <mask> such things . they probably do not even know what the term even means .
if you are often out and about in the evening , more <mask> car , you will know what a back seat can look like after having partied through the night : clothes , bottles and other rubbish begin to pile up .
a few bags won &apos;t make much of a difference there - in contrast to on the street where no ##at##-##at## one wants to trample through other peoples &apos; <mask> food .
