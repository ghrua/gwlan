<mask> : increased safety for pedestrians
<mask> , the new b 33 pedestrian lights in dorfparkplatz in gutach became operational - within view of the existing town hall traffic lights .
<mask> silly error ?
<mask> , gutacht &apos;s mayor gave a clear answer to this question .
<mask> lights were installed because this was a school route , &quot; explained eckert yesterday .
<mask> residents of bergle .
<mask> , which officially became operational yesterday , is of importance to the sulzbachweg / kirchstrasse junction .
<mask> the spa gardens , the bus stop , a doctor &apos;s practice and a bank , not to mention the traffic from the &apos; grub &apos; residential area .
<mask> lights were required to ensure safety , &quot; said eckert .
<mask> also confirmed by peter arnold from the offenburg district office .
<mask> traffic accounts for around ten per cent , &quot; emphasised arnold .
<mask> safety comes first , it &apos;s that simple , &quot; said arnold .
<mask> account of the narrowness of the sulzbachweg / kirchstrasse junctions .
<mask> such vehicles could access the b 33 from the sulzbachweg without knocking over the traffic light posts &quot; .
<mask> explained arnold .
<mask> drivers can easily see the lights , even when the sun is low in the sky .
<mask> just eight .

<mask> the new system : it is fitted with two radar sensors .
<mask> checks the traffic status .
<mask> delay of around 15 seconds .
<mask> radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be ended .
<mask> disabled persons are crossing the street , the green phase is extended , thus ensuring that everyone gets safely across the street , &quot; explained arnold .
<mask> , drivers must also play their part and keep their eyes on the road .

<mask> does the highly charged performance start to wind down , and we see flashes of winkler &apos;s somewhat absurd sense of humour .

<mask> tea party is aghast .
<mask> , too , raising a variety of privacy issues .
<mask> on whether to proceed , several states are not waiting .
<mask> move to a system in which drivers pay per mile of road they roll over .
<mask> already taken the black boxes , some of which have gps monitoring , for a test drive .
<mask> really is a must for our nation .
<mask> , which is planning for the state to start tracking miles driven by every california motorist by 2025 .
<mask> is going to be a change in how we pay these taxes .
<mask> do it .
<mask> &apos;s highway trust fund , financed with taxes americans pay at the gas pump , is broke .

<mask> sustainable , &quot; said lee munnich , a transportation policy expert at the university of minnesota .
<mask> cars to test out a pay ##at##-##at## by ##at##-##at## mile system .
<mask> most logical alternative over the long term , &quot; he said .
<mask> user fee .
<mask> as the taxes could be rigged to change driving patterns in ways that could help reduce congestion and greenhouse gases , for example .
<mask> planners are looking to the system as they devise strategies to meet the goals laid out in the state &apos;s ambitious global warming laws .
<mask> it as the most viable long ##at##-##at## term alternative .
<mask> foundation are also fond of having drivers pay per mile .
<mask> tax going into a black hole , &quot; said adrian moore , vice president of policy at reason .
<mask> more directly into what they are getting .
<mask> who in a 2011 report urged congress to move in the pay ##at##-##at## per ##at##-##at## mile direction .
<mask> involved about 10,000 cars .
<mask> daily lives often involve logging lots of miles to get to work or into town .
<mask> are nonetheless moving ahead on their own .

<mask> of individuals &apos; everyday comings and goings .
<mask> many miles a car is being driven , but not exactly where and at what time .
<mask> khan said , the public gets more comfortable .
<mask> that technology has led some state agencies to a small california startup called true mileage .
<mask> the business of helping states tax drivers .
<mask> into an emerging market in auto insurance , in which drivers would pay based on their mileage .
<mask> gps and deliver a limited amount of information , uploaded periodically by modem .
<mask> , &quot; said ryan morrison , chief executive of true mileage .
<mask> of these state pilot programs .
<mask> a lot less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this .
<mask> with giving drivers different choices .
<mask> or without gps .
<mask> instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles driven by all state residents .
<mask> devices do more , not less .
<mask> device that would also be equipped to pay parking meter fees , provide &quot; pay ##at##-##at## as ##at##-##at## you ##at##-##at## drive &quot; insurance , and create a pool of real ##at##-##at## time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic .

<mask> geisingen
<mask> geisingen , to mark the 1,250th
<mask> documented mention of the town , are drawing closer .
<mask> anniversary year will be upon us .
<mask> documented together in the year 794 .
<mask> was drafted in kirchen , in which both towns are mentioned .
<mask> and because geisingen currently has no suitable venues , this launch event will take place in the location where the two towns were first documented 1,250 years ago , in kirchen ##at##-##at## hausen .
<mask> ##at##-##at## hausen .
<mask> will celebrate the 1,250th anniversary with a celebratory weekend from 18 to 20
<mask> .
<mask> be held at the kirchtalhalle .

<mask> geisingen town anniversary , a new chronicle will also be published .
<mask> a printed work on the geisingen of today , which now consists of geisingen , kirchen ##at##-##at## hausen , leipferdingen , aulfingen and gutmadingen , &quot; said mayor walter hengstler .
<mask> incorporations to form the current region were completed .
<mask> 21 or 22 november in the new festival hall in geisingen .

<mask> sets its sights on rail system
<mask> be reconstructed at great cost , in order to increase traffic safety ?
<mask> that the answer is yes .
<mask> have to contribute up to eur 220,000 to the project .
<mask> hopes to improve the kinzigtal railway line in the coming year .
<mask> occur at these across the country .
<mask> be required to contribute one third of the costs , with the remainder divided between deutsche bahn and the federal government .
<mask> mason , roland grießhaber , explained the peculiarities of the &quot; am hirschen &quot; railway crossing to the town council .
<mask> tunnel to the west of the railway line .
<mask> to wait there in the event of oncoming traffic , without having to block the railway line .
<mask> in order to guarantee the smooth flow of traffic .
<mask> the town council , as some council members cast doubt over the need to widen the road : thomas kipp summarised the perspective of the critics with this statement : &quot; do we have to hand over so much money on account of so few vehicles ? &quot;
<mask> used regularly for the transportation of long logs .
<mask> as the vehicles , which measure 20 metres in length , would not be able to use the route via the häberles bridge , as they would not be able to make the turn on the hauptstrasse .
<mask> hauptstrasse is blocked , the route would also serve as a bypass for those vehicles that are not permitted to use the tunnel , argued haas .
<mask> case in wolfach , the &quot; am hirschen &quot; railway crossing may become of major traffic significance for a longer period of time .
<mask> what costs the planned widening of the road would incur .
<mask> supporting wall be built in such a way that the town could , if required , extend the connecting road in the &quot; bahnhofstraße &quot; direction to around 5.5 metres to accommodate oncoming traffic .
<mask> the railway crossing at the trautwein tannery could , on the other hand , bring with it an entirely different problem with regard to access to the steep &quot; geroltzhäuser weg &quot; .
<mask> the breinlinger engineering office , as they had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the geroltzhäuser weg will be straightforward .
<mask> road could result in longer vehicles becoming stuck .
<mask> for road construction , would then bear responsibility for this .
<mask> result in liability disputes .
<mask> not be consented to , argued haas .
<mask> lower than at other railway crossings , on account of the fact that there is a midpoint from which there is a good line of sight , directly alongside the stopping point .
<mask> must also be sufficiently slowed down so that there is no threat of collision .
<mask> to deny any responsibility following the completion of the construction work .
<mask> vor kuhbach &quot; railway crossings , for which the crossing agreements have already been reached with deutsche bahn , to be unproblematic .
<mask> decision on major space missions : missions costing billions
<mask> holes - experts from the european space agency must now agree on two major projects that are to be launched in the coming years .
<mask> in the running .
<mask> worlds .
<mask> planets near other stars .
<mask> these , no ##at##-##at## one knows .
<mask> we search for gravitational waves ?
<mask> cosmos ?
<mask> earth and thus perhaps discover extraterrestrial life ?
<mask> the questions currently being asked by those responsible at the european space agency , esa .
<mask> projects , which should greatly advance research .
<mask> .
<mask> start in 2028 and 2034 .
<mask> paris to discuss proposals for such missions .
<mask> it onto the short list .
<mask> are assessing the proposals , posing questions to the researchers .
<mask> be made by the scientific programme committee .
<mask> &quot; cosmic vision &quot; programme , initiated in 2007 , are to find the answers .
<mask> and life ?
<mask> large gas clouds - and thus the formation of the planets that orbit these stars - lie in proverbial darkness .
<mask> .
<mask> can life exist there ?
<mask> which 500 known planetary systems in proximity to us will be investigated in greater detail .
<mask> cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euro .
<mask> earth and even analyse the composition of their atmospheres , and thus search for &quot; biomarkers &quot; : gases that serve as an indicator for biological activity .

<mask> icy moons europa , callisto and ganymede .
<mask> physical laws of the universe ?
<mask> whether the laws of nature , as known to us , are still valid there .
<mask> show physicians the path to a new theory , under the umbrella of which all known natural laws could be united .
<mask> about and what does it consist of ?
<mask> created by the big bang .
<mask> exists dark matter , the gravitational force of which holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together , and dark energy , the effects of which accelerate the expansion of the universe .
<mask> bang , nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of .
<mask> ##at##-##at## mission , planned to commence in 2020 .
<mask> thus enabling conclusions to be drawn regarding the properties of dark matter and dark energy .
<mask> ...
<mask> at the end of the selection procedure .
<mask> , a demanding concept that aims to prove the existence of gravitational waves .
<mask> ##at##-##at## time , which albert einstein predicted almost 100 years ago .
<mask> proved to exist .
<mask> project hope that elisa could achieve this .
<mask> involves placing a detector , consisting of two or three probes , in outer space .
<mask> waves created during the big bang , and thus provide fresh knowledge regarding the origin of the cosmos .
<mask> for the measurement of cosmic background radiation , and the &quot; exoplanet finder &quot; , which would find and investigate planets similar to earth .
<mask> ruled out include proposals for bringing samples back from mars , conducting research on the moon , venus and asteroids , as well as proposals in the area of solar physics .
<mask> surveillance
<mask> snowden , the us intelligence whistleblower , has declared that he is willing to travel to berlin to give evidence to the german parliament if the us national security agency and its director keith alexander fail to provide answers about its activities .
<mask> russia , where he has been granted asylum , to discuss him testifying in germany .
<mask> snowden , presented to the media in berlin on friday by the mp , said : &quot; though the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat dissent as defection , and seeks to criminalise political speech with felony charges that provide no defence . &quot;
<mask> the truth is not a crime .

<mask> mean puberty is imminent
<mask> to blame
<mask> of early puberty
<mask> early puberty is not as pronounced with boys
<mask> is a journalist specializing in children &apos;s health and family issues .
<mask> mother be alarmed if her daughter begins to sprout breast buds and pubic hair at 7 or 8 ?
<mask> orlando , florida , pediatric endocrinologist dr. paul kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among american girls and represent a new norm .
<mask> a lot of time reassuring parents -- usually , this does not signal a rapid progression into full puberty , &quot; said kaplowitz .
<mask> hair and body odor are appearing sooner in girls .
<mask> menarche ( the first period ) over the past four decades .
<mask> states , the average age is 12.5 years , down from 12.75 in 1970 .
<mask> said kaplowitz , also author of &quot; early puberty in girls : the essential guide to coping with this common problem . &quot;
<mask> the most accurate test of how puberty is going to progress .
<mask> &quot; when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spurt before age 8 .
<mask> stall -- something a pediatrician can monitor closely .
<mask> to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts .
<mask> the bones that ultimately can lead to stunted growth and being short as an adult .
<mask> rate of development , growth rate and emotional maturity .
<mask> aspects are important , too .
<mask> is cautious with medication but acknowledges , &quot; suppressing puberty may alleviate behavioral issues and girls &apos; feelings of being different from peers . &quot;
<mask> don &apos;t want their very young daughters having periods .
<mask> or even how they will handle hygiene , &quot; said kaplowitz .
<mask> &quot; recalls one woman whose daughter started her period at 10 .
<mask> not emotionally prepared .
<mask> school scared and upset to be the first among her friends .
<mask> are lots of well ##at##-##at## publicized theories about the causes of precocious puberty .
<mask> foods , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are to blame .
<mask> earlier .
<mask> holds the most weight is the epidemic of obesity .
<mask> that links body fat to the timing of puberty .
<mask> this conclusion , but there are many other contributing factors .
<mask> reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts .
<mask> varying explanations .
<mask> to genes .
<mask> at younger ages , the trend toward full ##at##-##at## blown early puberty is not as pronounced as it is with girls .
<mask> doctors attending the aap conference reinforced the complexities of the topic .
<mask> and pubic hair is common even in infants and toddlers .
<mask> identify the true onset of puberty , &quot; said dr. lawrence silverman , a pediatric endocrinologist at goryeb children &apos;s hospital in morristown , new jersey .
<mask> how to talk with their child .
<mask> kaplowitz advised .
<mask> , your child usually will respond well .
<mask> need reassurance that , even when it happens ahead of schedule , the process is a normal part of life .
<mask> feud over seat width with big orders at stake

<mask> seat measurements and says it is not up to manufacturers to step into decisions on how airlines balance fares and facilities .
<mask> .
<mask> allowing them to do the things that they believe they need to do to be successful , &quot; said boeing cabins expert kent craver .
<mask> &apos;t want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable .
<mask> know their business better than anyone else .
<mask> but for suppliers it is increasingly an issue that could affect earnings .
<mask> dispute is a race for plane orders with at least $ 700 ##at##-##at## billion of estimated business at list prices in coming decades , enough to tip the scales of u.s. and european exports .
<mask> is exactly what drives the battle between the latest jets .
<mask> than the market leader in that segment , the 365 ##at##-##at## seat boeing 777 ##at##-##at## 300er .
<mask> performance claims depend in part on comparing the 10 ##at##-##at## abreast 777x with an original 9 ##at##-##at## abreast 777 design .
<mask> in unit costs is blunted compared with 10 ##at##-##at## abreast now in use .
<mask> to make their plane more competitive with our products , &quot; said kevin keniston , head of passenger comfort at europe &apos;s airbus .
<mask> for the denser layout , which may go hand in hand with cheaper fares .
<mask> point of the airbus proposal is driven by the threat of the 777 , &quot; said cabin interiors expert mary kirby , founder and editor of the runway girl network .
<mask> do not supply seats but offer a catalogue of suppliers for airlines to choose from .
<mask> check on competing layouts .
<mask> high ##at##-##at## density layouts for low ##at##-##at## cost airlines and regional travel .

<mask> the question of how people today view the &quot; end times &quot; after death .
<mask> people in past centuries were overly conscious of it , focusing on the pictures of heaven and hell &quot; that up until now have defined our ideas &quot; , contemporary prophetic teaching on the hope of consummation is characterised more by a certain bashfulness , or even speechlessness .
