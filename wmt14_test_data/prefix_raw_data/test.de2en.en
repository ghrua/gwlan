it is <mask>
with burfien , the regional church has for first time commissioned a minister <mask>
at present , fewer and fewer young people are deciding to study theology after their <mask>

&quot; it is a double bonus , &quot; says proctor now , &quot; in actual fact being vegan is not about doing without , it &apos;s not about asceticism , but rather it is an enhancement &quot; . regarding the assumption that when you convert your diet you are reducing your choice of meal options , proctor puts <mask>

when you cook together there is a certain dynamic - cooking <mask>
