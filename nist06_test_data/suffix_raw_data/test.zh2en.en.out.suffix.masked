<mask> news items .
<mask> rather shocking piece of news in japanese political circles .
<mask> against koizumi 's visit to yasukuni shrine. furthermore , the yomiuri shimbun has since taken a position against koizumi 's visit to yasukuni shrine .
<mask> ignorant and has no knowledge of any history or culture .
<mask> that by doing so , koizumi also made china and south korea consider japan a very dangerous country. this is going to have no end of trouble .
<mask> could tsuneo watanabe , his attitude trigger great impact ?
<mask> very influential in political circles and has been a manipulator behind the scenes all along .
<mask> a very rightist figure .
<mask> always supported hawks and also pushed vigorously for constitutional amendment .
<mask> turn .
<mask> koizumi and started to oppose such a stance .
<mask> 2004 when someone attacked koizumi for visiting yasukuni shrine , um , tsuneo watanabe , he still said , he said , er , he supported him and wanted koizumi to resist the pressure .
<mask> , he gave a speech recently. he said , i am already more than 80 years old and don 't have much time left .
<mask> in his speech .
<mask> great social impact in japan .
<mask> i have the actual power of controlling and changing the political orientation .
<mask> shimbun 's freedom of speech and freedom of coverage and compilation be under the government pressure , he would resist it at the risk of his life .
<mask> , what kind of situation has it come to now ?
<mask> newspaper in japan , and the asahi shimbun , the second largest newspaper in japan , now these two large newspapers have started to join hands in opposing koizumi 's visit to yasukuni shrine .
<mask> at least reached consensus on this issue .
<mask> forming what we could call a dream team .
<mask> , these two large newspapers of theirs should have a very large influence on japanese mainstream public opinion .
<mask> , two relatively popular candidates for successor to japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi made the same remark .
<mask> ?
<mask> aso , who has made a series of appalling remarks recently .
<mask> two make ?
<mask> japan 's wwii criminals were not criminals .
<mask> called them criminals and convicted them .
<mask> , in japan , according to the international law , they were ; according to the domestic law in japan , er , the war criminals did not violate the domestic law of japan .
<mask> wwii criminals should not be considered criminals in japan .
<mask> now focus its vision on the whole world and develop relations with the united states and develop commercial and trade relations with , um , some east asian countries. in addition , it should also try its best to develop close ties with india. it should not always focus on china .
<mask> but not assured
<mask> , love luneng
<mask> soon be lit on the battlefield of the chinese super league .
<mask> getting ready for the new season and preparing to fight again for the championship .
<mask> shanghai is on the verge of breaking out .
<mask> the championship in the end ?
<mask> taishan team has great hopes of winning the championship , it is not 100 percent assured .
<mask> have little time to get adjusted .
<mask> year .
<mask> foreign players. its strength should be said to have increased without decreasing .
<mask> coordination between the national team players and their teammates .
<mask> , the super league will be starting .
<mask> the problem of getting adjusted is the biggest problem the taishan team now faces .
<mask> serve as substitutes in the first few super league matches .
<mask> get the team adjusted .
<mask> to take a rest .
<mask> skills in several matches , it will not be too late to enter the battle .
<mask> hidden troubles on defense .
<mask> year , the taishan team 's defense was criticized by football fans .
<mask> of li leilei , but it 's not yet time to rest easy .
<mask> either slightly old or lack sufficient experience .
<mask> winning the championship .
<mask> in good physical shape. despite insufficient experience , he can test himself this year and prepare for the future .
<mask> also fine to recall gao yao to play sweeper .
<mask> the taishan team who can play defensive midfield. both cui peng and haibin can play .
<mask> job as central back .
<mask> players can adjust themselves ...
<mask> big problem for the taishan team .
<mask> be desired .
<mask> foreign players for this year have not been determined yet .
<mask> , a pure left midfielder should be recruited .
<mask> taishan team has not had a single true left-footed specialist .
<mask> left midfielder is still much better than a stand-in .
<mask> team should be a bit smoother .
<mask> taishan team will win the championship this year .
<mask> great hopes but there are few assurances .
<mask> to say happy new year ?
<mask> post :
<mask> everyone .
<mask> behind us. our friends who combined their vacation days with spring festival holidays are returning to their work .
<mask> , if it is still not too late to say happy new year .
<mask> chatting with nplcn in a cafe the other day , he mentioned the current brandvista .
<mask> much prettier .
<mask> good .
<mask> the recent fully revamped discuz-based community bbs .
<mask> have to thank one person .
<mask> li mingshun , general manager of discuz beijing company .
<mask> you can get a lot of hits .
<mask> internet ad exchange platform for small and medium-sized businesses , similar to adbrite.com abroad .
<mask> the effect that vista thinks that the development of many sectors in china all depends on private economy and growth of small and medium-sized businesses .
<mask> now is not encouraging .
<mask> media sector and the similar consulting sector serving small and medium-sized businesses are unable to grow into large scale .
<mask> to an unfulfilling cycle .
<mask> to discuz .
<mask> excellent community software based on php and mysql database .
<mask> look .
<mask> .
<mask> and friendly .
<mask> is quite fast .
<mask> of happiness .
<mask> , discuz !
<mask> of news lately in the advertising sector .
<mask> went into effect .
<mask> arriving at the scene , while smaller foreign companies are getting ready. prosperity seems to be everywhere .
<mask> has encountered quite a lot of trouble .
<mask> in mainland china , sir martin finally found some time away from the lawsuit in italy to think about reshuffling his cards .
<mask> its brand name under the jwt management .
<mask> that bates and the 141 network will soon merge with ogilvyone and will be managed by the ogilvyone ad network .
<mask> it to ogilvyone .
<mask> have been updated on the website. i will not go into details here .
<mask> you have time .
<mask> time , those friends who have not entered the new forum may as well make an extra click to access the brand-new community at brandvista
<mask> atmosphere as well as to contribute some texts .
<mask> happiness of finding where you belong .
<mask> beautiful state of mind .

<mask> to share it with you .
<mask> out of a momentary impulse but of warmth and kindness cherished long at heart .
<mask> would act if it were me .
<mask> down the phone with a " you dialed a wrong number . "
<mask> can be considered helping others .
<mask> already given up those momentary actions such as making monetary or material donations .
<mask> the energy to do it .
<mask> a pleasant day : )
<mask> ago
<mask> years ago , when this teacher was taking a nap at home during noontime break , the telephone rang suddenly .
<mask> a strange rough voice : " we have caught your kid stealing a book. come here quick ! "
<mask> scolding voices of others .
<mask> her .
<mask> while she was stealing a book. as she did not want to let her family know it , she must have made up a phone number at random. that was how they happened to call here .
<mask> she could put down the phone and ignored the call. she could also even reprimand the other party ,
<mask> incident had nothing to do with her .
<mask> her own student .
<mask> made the momentary slip , must be very much frightened and was facing perhaps the most horrifying situation in her life .
<mask> just do it this way .
<mask> hurried there .
<mask> she expected , a tearful little girl was standing in the bookstore ,
<mask> in fierce reproof .
<mask> to the sales person nearby : " talk to me. don 't scare the kid . "
<mask> take a close look at that tear-smudged , terrified face .
<mask> girl home. she gave her a good cleaning and let the girl go without asking anything .
<mask> auntie 's place. there are many books inside .
<mask> and scampered away. she never reappeared .
<mask> it .
<mask> , leading a quiet and peaceful life .
<mask> on the door .
<mask> with all smiles on her face and her hands full of gifts .
<mask> ? "
<mask> doubtfully .
<mask> girl said a great deal .
<mask> to visit her .
<mask> why you were willing to pretend to be my mom to help me out , i have always felt all these ten years that i want to call you mom . "
<mask> eyes also grew blurry .
<mask> had not helped you , what would have happened ? "
<mask> not sure. i could have done something foolish and might have even committed suicide . "
<mask> secretly .
<mask> impact on one person 's life .
<mask> smile on the girl 's face , she also smiled .

<mask> : how long would iran be able to hold on against us military air strikes ?
<mask> feiquan
<mask> bleed to death , then modern warfare is firing a bullet right into the enemy 's head at the outset , turning it into a " vegetable " with no time to bleed .
<mask> in military power is not in the numbers but in their understanding of modern warfare .
<mask> winner , does not seem to understand the real significance of modern high-tech warfare .
<mask> deployments , that us troops are preparing to launch a large-scale air strike on iran ...
<mask> air force is rather worrisome .
<mask> iranian air force is very similar to the pre-war iraqi air force in 2003 .
<mask> under the arms embargo imposed by the west .
<mask> fight the us military .
<mask> air defense force of iran 's regular military as well as the air defense force of the revolutionary guard corps .
<mask> 50,000 strong and has more than 300 fighter planes of various models .
<mask> are us-made f-4 phantoms , f-5 tigers , and f-14 tomcats , and russian-made mig-29s , among others .
<mask> hawk , british-made arrow , and some russian-made sam series surface-to-air missiles .
<mask> are still some holes in iran 's air defense capabilities and its air defense system construction .
<mask> at the same level as the us military .
<mask> lack of spare parts , upgrades , and maintenance .
<mask> only 10-plus can take off .
<mask> in actual battle .
<mask> the 1970s and 1980s have lost combat power due to lack of spare parts .
<mask> countermeasures .
<mask> on combat power .
<mask> fate in war depends on its ability to defend the home skies. in a last-minute effort to update its weaponry , it scraped together all it could get to reinforce its air defense system .
<mask> present , its methods can be summarized into two .
<mask> to enhance its capability to defend against attacks .
<mask> nuclear facilities such as the natanz nuclear plant and isfahan uranium enrichment center as deep as 18 meters underground and encased them with 2-meter thick cement protection .
<mask> underground bunkers during the 1991 gulf war in defending against air strikes , it rushed development of various kinds of ground penetrating bombs .
<mask> , the us military now has a complete package of combat methodology and weapons to deal with reinforced underground bunkers .
<mask> recently also bought large quantities of air defense weaponry from russia .
<mask> russia to purchase the pechora-2a air defense missile system , along with 29 sets of the tor-m1 air defense missile system worth 700 million us dollars .
<mask> competition between systems .
<mask> set of impressive and effective war machines .
<mask> such short period of time is still an issue .
<mask> only .
<mask> nothing more than " meat on the chopping board " no matter how powerful its regular military strength .
<mask> planes the enemy had but the range of its own tomahawk cruise missiles .
<mask> seem to understand the real significance of modern high-tech warfare .
<mask> , the us military 's air strike operations already completely differ from vietnam war era carpet bombing , depending instead on various kinds of high-tech weapons and on modern information technology-based high precision and full depth air attacks .
<mask> hold on .

<mask> charges software vendors " shelving fees ? "

<mask> is testing personal computers that have installed google pack .
<mask> market .
<mask> indicated that the company is evaluating google 's software .
<mask> pc .
<mask> software being tested by the company include a google-supported dell homepage , google desktop search , and google toolbar .
<mask> his company and dell were testing a bundle of software developed by google .
<mask> among others , in hopes of convincing these computer manufacturing giants to include google software in their pcs .
<mask> google may pay up to 1 billion us dollars to dell over the next three years to achieve this goal .
<mask> any of the relevant details .
<mask> , hewlett packard refused to comment .
<mask> press spokesman neil charney refused to comment on the above news .
<mask> boost its development of web services .
<mask> 4.46 % to 367.92 us dollars .
<mask> 26.94 us dollars .
<mask> pc giants such as dell may cause google to threaten microsoft 's core business .
<mask> in a rush to expand its revenue sources , which is definitely something microsoft is concerned about .
<mask> , some analysts are rather unimpressed .
<mask> early for google to shake microsoft windows ' dominant position .
<mask> : google shaking microsoft 's throne ?
<mask> modern people in their life and work .
<mask> operating principle of a computer .
<mask> use , most beginners can equally feel comfortable operating such a black box as a computer .
<mask> determine the usage habits of most consumers .
<mask> the pc operating system market .
<mask> finger in the pie through this means .
<mask> media outfit recently used a very interesting metaphor for this .
<mask> software companies " shelving fees . "
<mask> computers so as to guide consumers to use their products .
<mask> supermarkets charge food suppliers shelving fees . "
<mask> loosened .
<mask> if google began to pay pc manufacturers to have their computers installed with google software when they are shipped out , then microsoft 's hegemony will eventually be threatened .
<mask> may become history .
<mask> is easier to win the throne than to keep the throne .

<mask> beginning of 2005 , hong kong 's apple daily published an article entitled " as falun wheel revolves , its contributions rival those of government . "
<mask> .
<mask> falun gong practitioners told the truth all over the world , making the cpc completely lose face .
<mask> " nine commentaries " in 2005 , the year 2004 did not seem impressive .
<mask> will things be like in 2006 ?
<mask> year 's developments .
<mask> by the falun gong founder. this article announced the imminent doom of those who became cpc spies after july 20 , 1999 .
<mask> still skeptical about or cannot believe this article .
<mask> believing it or not , history and facts will be the proof !
<mask> living in the sewer .
<mask> " natural or accidental " deaths won 't rouse social or public attention .
<mask> or repentance by cpc spies both at home and abroad will surely produce a powerful impact and shock to the cpc power structure .
<mask> they will have to seriously consider their route of retreat and survival - withdrawal from the party , defection , or counterattack .
<mask> by filthy interests will start to shake , crumble , and collapse !
<mask> human rights .
<mask> potential at the beginning , on the contrary received an unexpectedly enthusiastic response from around the world , and a joint response from various sectors and forces at that .
<mask> suffering masses , making it a widespread success , then there is hope that an external force will take shape from this to serve as the last straw for the unstable , evil cpc regime .
<mask> cpc will be eliminated both spiritually and materially .
<mask> the life of the cpc devil will officially enter the count-down period .
<mask> ; the power of god and the people are converging .
<mask> pointing directly at the cpc devil .
<mask> then what will be the final conclusion for 2006 ?
<mask> and triumph !

<mask> li qun , linyi municipal party committee secretary
<mask> ( sunny ) ,

<mask> a letter to li qun , linyi municipal party committee secretary - hooliganism may also harm yourself
<mask> ( yjrg.net )
<mask> days .
<mask> taking illegal custody of a lawful blind citizen for a long time .
<mask> the phone line in his home and installed a cell phone interference device in his courtyard .
<mask> and his family members several times .
<mask> exceeded the bottom line of a civilized society .
<mask> in the underground society and beat attorney li fangping and me , but we put up with it , always trying our best to understand the difficulties you people are in. we even acquiesced for some time after you people put chen guangcheng under house arrest .
<mask> even have become more unscrupulous .
<mask> dispatched regiments of police and hooligans to harass villagers .
<mask> villagers .
<mask> gone too far !
<mask> guangcheng , i remind you explicitly that acting as hooligans in the underground society may backfire and harm yourself .
<mask> beginning should have warranted your reconsideration .
<mask> planning in linyi ranked at the bottom in the entire province .
<mask> municipal party committee secretary .
<mask> linyi are so crude that force must be used to implement the national law and policy .
<mask> it if citizens did not cooperate with the government 's action ?
<mask> over a long period of time ?
<mask> not appear that absurd , don 't you think your barbarous action was way out of line in 2005 when the chinese society had achieved remarkable progress and when the human rights protection had been written into the constitution ?
<mask> linyi alone dare do such things ?
<mask> rule of law ?
<mask> barbarous way of implementing the law , after teng biao and a number of legal professionals daring to safeguard citizens ' rights got involved , and after the national family planning commission made the conclusion of the investigation , linyi should have offered a sincere explanation to gain the understanding of the public .
<mask> tough subject with chinese characteristics .
<mask> could also have understood your difficulties .
<mask> move - catching chen guangcheng in beijing and bringing him back to be locked up. you even attempted to incriminate him in the name of illegally supplying state secret intelligence .
<mask> a blind person living in a poor mountain village ?
<mask> have done a good job , would you be afraid of the criticism by a blind person ?
<mask> it necessary to dispatch tens of people to watch him 24 hours a day and even feel so exasperated as to convict him ?
<mask> and hoped to resolve the contradiction .
<mask> what idea and request you people had .
<mask> not to make certain remarks .
<mask> not treat a blind person this way and that both sides should make some concessions .
<mask> incident of beating and illegally detaining us .
<mask> can scare us this way ?
<mask> not done anything illegal .
<mask> of anything .
<mask> as to allow lawlessness .
<mask> of hooligans in the underground society , then you have far underestimated our resolution and willpower .
<mask> go to linyi or visit chen guangcheng .
<mask> three times. each time there will be widespread attention and coverage .
<mask> us ten times ?
<mask> your official position ?
<mask> really that secure ?
<mask> to our reasonable advice , don 't you think this is not only foolish but also risky ?
<mask> conscience and abide by the rule of law .
<mask> .
<mask> cannot tolerate the reckless trampling of the bottom line of human civilization .
<mask> retreat .
<mask> of hooligans in the underground society will not be of any good to you .
<mask> those local ruffians and hooligans who beat up villagers as long as you stay behind the scenes .
<mask> guangcheng well .
<mask> for the villagers. he is known far and wide as " attorney chen . "
<mask> far by doing that ?
<mask> put chen guangcheng under house arrest. it is also risky to you .
<mask> you people could have released him with no trouble .
<mask> barbarous implementation of the law has stopped , how long will he go on criticizing if left unchecked ?
<mask> continuing to smear your own image .
<mask> will never have peace .
<mask> have tortured him enough .
<mask> him or resort to further hooliganism , we will never look on with folded arms .

<mask> people deserve democracy ?
<mask> emancipation of chinese people .
<mask> admit that the chinese people do not deserve democracy !
<mask> ?
<mask> read it online ( compared with 1.4 billion ) .
<mask> are concerned with or participate in topics like this. i dare say it is less than 1 % of netizens !
<mask> and highest quality project !
<mask> .
<mask> , helpless , even thinking of submission , but if i want to live a human life , who else can i count on but myself to make it happen ?
<mask> i have not tried hard for my own ideals .
<mask> in my self-appraisal .
<mask> i don 't have to worry about the future of china at all .
<mask> regime that has not held elections for a long time .
<mask> is just a matter of time .
<mask> that some people call glorious the bones of the dead and the puddles of blood along this road , and even force us to be proud of such glory .
<mask> it is the longest in the divine land of china .
<mask> the sage confucius brought huge disasters to people .
<mask> brainwashed in the shadows .
<mask> democracy gene is gone , having been made to regress .
<mask> democracy if there was an element of democracy in its national culture .
<mask> the british people , when the french people were issuing the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen , and when americans were issuing the declaration of independence , what were chinese people doing ?
<mask> to elect emperors. the manchus long ago had the council of princes and ministers to practice democratic administration. why did it all evaporate once they came to the region of the han people ?
<mask> pursue material things and are not interested at all in spiritual beliefs and political rights .
<mask> suffrage if they had it .
<mask> the earthquake will surely be coming. run if you can !

<mask> envoys meet with chinese officials behind closed doors
<mask> beili
<mask> meet with chinese officials behind closed doors .
<mask> not independence , for tibet .
<mask> spiritual leader in exile , are having closed-door meetings with chinese officials in beijing with no details released .
<mask> meeting between china and the dalai 's government-in-exile since contacts resumed in 2002 .
<mask> sides met behind close doors with no details revealed .
<mask> far no substantive results have been achieved .
<mask> that he wants autonomy , not independence , for tibet .
<mask> to comment on the bilateral talks .
<mask> dialogue partly because it is worried that tibetans ' dissatisfaction with the chinese rule may escalate should this 70-year-old spiritual leader in exile die .
<mask> identity
<mask> 's government-in-exile was led by lodi gyaltsen gyari , who was also chief representative to several previous talks .
<mask> for the tibetan government-in-exile said that the several rounds of talks they had with chinese officials in switzerland in 2005 were very " close and frank , " bringing hopes for tibetans .
<mask> is to resolve the relevant issues on the basis reached through negotiation with the chinese leadership so that tibetans will have the freedom to preserve their cultural identity , which they consider important .
<mask> beili
<mask> not seek tibet 's independence .
<mask> go to visit washington this month .
<mask> said that the tibetan government-in-exile would not demand for tibet 's independence .
<mask> unique culture and tradition .
<mask> bush can urge the chinese government to give tibet genuine autonomy .
<mask> year .
<mask> "
<mask> positive aspects when meeting with chinese authorities .
<mask> united front work department of the cpc central committee , were more willing than before to hear their opinions .
<mask> government-in-exile still has too many disagreements with the chinese government and that there is a very big difference between the positions of the two sides .
<mask> environment .
<mask> good environment for negotiations on the tibetan issue instead of suppressing the dalai lama unrelentingly .
<mask> unique culture so that " tibetans will have genuine autonomy . "
<mask> issue will disappear once the dalai lama dies .
<mask> will lose a historic opportunity to solve the tibetan issue once the dalai lama passes away .
<mask> talk about the tibetan issue internationally .
<mask> compromise are important democratic methods ! ( zt )
<mask> old mr. guiren .
<mask> of disagreements is the failure of democracy ! ! ! i hope idealistic democrats will pay full attention to this point ! "
<mask> any net friends led me to indulge in a train of thought while all sorts of feelings welled up in my mind .
<mask> thought of ancient china as well as the past of the west .
<mask> post .
<mask> at ancient china .
<mask> dynasties that followed operating under this political framework .
<mask> a political system consisting of a dual coexisting feudal system and centralized power system , after all , there was still a centralized power system in the end .
<mask> system under the conditions at that time in history had its progressive side , had its aspect of promoting the development of forces of production .
<mask> activity in local areas , making it even less possible to formulate , based on local conditions , various kinds of regulations and policies appropriate for local development .
<mask> officials to only look upward , following every detail of orders from higher levels .
<mask> themselves , let alone with those ordinary citizens .
<mask> their rights were infringed upon , peasants in ancient china could do nothing but put up with it time and again .
<mask> , would they rise in revolt with sharpened sticks .
<mask> yellow turban uprising , to the huang chao riot in the tang dynasty , as well as the one-month dynastic rule as a result of li zicheng 's uprising. except for zhu yuanzhang , none achieved victory in the true sense of the word .
<mask> zhu yuanzhang was still nothing but a rotating replacement of other dynasties , with no change in the system .
<mask> characteristic of the tang dynasty , born of openness , freedom , and tolerance , was replaced by stagnant lifelessness .
<mask> the land of china for some time .
<mask> suppression .
<mask> and dared not talk too much , from fear and trepidation .
<mask> the chinese people into subhuman beings for a period of time .
<mask> at the middle ages in western europe , known as the dark ages .
<mask> by nomads and had nothing to do with the previous ancient greece and rome .
<mask> .
<mask> lower levels had more independent power .
<mask> marquises , counts , viscounts , and barons who appeared on formal occasions , as people of various ranks were able to mutually check and balance and depend on one another , with the conditions and abilities to fight for their legitimate rights from the king , there were scenes of kings and noblemen sitting together for negotiations of their own respective interests , scenes never seen in ancient chinese history .
<mask> parties by using force .
<mask> kinds of contracts , rights were continuously granted to noblemen and commoners , and with increasing power for noblemen and commoners , the king 's rights became increasingly diminished .
<mask> only ceremonial , with no actual power .
<mask> through this method !
<mask> table over a cup of tea and a glass of wine , making mutual compromises and concessions in a relaxed and pleasant manner and formulating contracts to the satisfaction of the two sides .
<mask> the right of existence was deprived , the only way remaining was to overthrow the existing dynasty by force and try to replace it .
<mask> ming dynasty .
<mask> in ancient china .
<mask> were peasant uprisings as frequent as in ancient china .
<mask> ancient royal households and peasants arose , noblemen and commoners would first think of achieving resolution through negotiations to protect their own interests. they would make some mutual concessions to gradually win more rights , while force was rarely used .
<mask> ultra , absolute totalitarian system of the ming dynasty ,
<mask> talk about nothing except annihilation and overthrow .
<mask> don 't understand that negotiation , consultation , and compromise are the most important methods and approaches for realizing democracy .
<mask> for enriching rural cultural activities ?
<mask> spend the holiday in rural china and visit some relatives and friends .
<mask> the countryside .
<mask> a local theatrical show called " revolving lantern . "
<mask> of watching it .
<mask> in their own villages but also visited other villages , creating liveliness through their exchanges .
<mask> year this village no longer organized it .
<mask> sum of money was needed for purchasing costumes alone for " revolving lantern . " in the past , costumes were bought through fund raising among the villagers , yet they are now too worn out to wear .
<mask> for money again , nobody wanted to do it. similar situations also occurred in several other villages across the township .
<mask> and cheerless .
<mask> started to play mahjong .
<mask> .
<mask> all said there was nothing going on for this new year festival .
<mask> one of the major features of the new year celebration in rural areas .
<mask> outside have become major players at gambling houses .
<mask> sweat over a whole year thereby goes down the drain .
<mask> some even lead to tragedies of divorce and death .
<mask> new year festival , but also frequently participate in gambling during the slack season .
<mask> if they don 't gamble .
<mask> rural areas .
<mask> are no people acting as organizers .
<mask> has done is doubtlessly good news for peasants .
<mask> supported by townships , provided for peasant enjoyment , "
<mask> million yuan annually to a special fund for rural cultural enterprises , so as to bring high-quality cultural products to the rural population .
<mask> special fund for rural cultural enterprise .
<mask> " paid with this special fund are for real benefits :
<mask> rural areas , with at least four performances per year in each township ;
<mask> areas , with at least six dramas and educational science movies per year in each administrative village ;
<mask> local characteristics , with at least 2-3 events per year in each township .
<mask> " purchase inventory list , " it is easy for us to see that the government is not simply providing funds , but trying its best to think about how to use the limited funding to provide what is most needed and to bring value-added cultural enjoyment for the vast rural population. it has done a real job .
<mask> being exempt from paying grain tax to the government .
<mask> to " foot the bill " for enriching rural people 's cultural activities , it will be another joy from heaven for peasants .
<mask> away from the mahjong table but also get them " active " in cultural activities , which helps add contributions to the construction of new socialist rural areas .
<mask> wang peirong 's child almost got kidnapped
<mask> @ gmail.com
<mask> almost got kidnapped , but it turned out to be a false alarm .
<mask> on january 24 , 2006 , wang peirong 's child gave a full account :
<mask> was attending a make-up class in physics in the xuzhou no . 3 middle school .
<mask> three unidentified men said to the no . 3 middle school entrance guard , wang peirong 's child wang tianjiao has not been home for three days due to her parents ' quarrel .
<mask> we are the leaders at her mother 's workplace , we want to go inside the no . 3 middle school to take away wang peirong 's child .
<mask> that what these three men said were all lies , and she refused to go with these three men .
<mask> away .
<mask> peirong 's child called her mother 's leader at noon to investigate this incident , and that leader denied having sent anyone to the xuzhou no . 3 middle school .
<mask> leader 's telephone number from her .
<mask> her father 's leader .
<mask> child said : " three people came to the no . 3 middle scholl and wanted to take me away . "
<mask> 't you go with them ? "
<mask> 's child answered : " i will surely die if i go with them . "
<mask> saying that , wang peirong 's child hung up the phone .
<mask> what wang peirong 's child said , wang peirong felt it was a serious case and reported it to police .
<mask> what wang peirong 's child had said was basically true .
<mask> of mining and technology whether it had sent anyone to find wang peirong 's child at the no . 3 middle school. the answer was no .
<mask> had sent anyone to find wang peirong 's child at the no . 3 middle school. the answer was another no .
<mask> department asked others to tell wang peirong and his family to pay attention to their safety .
<mask> the incident , the leaders of the relevant departments in xuzhou city took it seriously .
<mask> investigation department of the xuzhou municipal public security bureau , the possibility of child kidnapping was ruled out .
<mask> as the criminal investigation department of the xuzhou municipal public security bureau .
<mask> the false alarm was probably caused mainly by the no . 3 middle school entrance guard .
<mask> peirong 's workplace , could not find wang peirong by phone. as they urgently needed to find wang peirong ( wang peirong has so far no idea what that was about ) , they thought of going to the no . 3 middle school to find the teacher of wang peirong 's child so as to ask whether the child was in xuzhou .
