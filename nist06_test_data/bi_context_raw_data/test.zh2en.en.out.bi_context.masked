experts think this is a groundless accusation against china 's normal national defense construction. it plays up " china military threat " and interferes in china 's <mask> .
the quadrennial defense review is the pentagon 's new <mask> document .
the 92-page-long report devoted three paragraphs to commenting on china 's military issues and the countermeasures the united states should take. directly mentioning the two phrases of " china " or " chinese " 15 times , the <mask> power , china has the greatest potential to compete militarily with the united states. if the united states does not have countermeasures , china will very likely develop disruptive military technologies so as to destroy us advantages in conventional weapons . "
yao yunzhu , a research fellow from the department of world military studies of the chinese military academy of sciences , said that though senior us officials expressed similar views on various occasions earlier , this is the first time the united states proposed in its " national defense strategy report " that " china <mask> militarily challenge the united states . "
" the report for the first time explicitly refers to russia , india and china as emerging strategic rivals ; in particular , more attention was given to the so-called ' <mask> military threat , ' "
said major general peng guangqian <mask> academy of sciences .
noticeably , on the same day the <mask> , us president bush also submitted a government budget for the 2007 fiscal year to congress , with the national defense budget at 439.3 billion us dollars .
" if the additional budget for military operations in iraq and afghanistan is added , the us national defense budget for 2007 fiscal year will go beyond the milestone of 500 billion dollars , an all time high , " peng guangqian said . " that is almost equal <mask> the world . "
peng guanqian thinks that the fabrication of " foreign threats " by the united states reflected the pentagon 's habitual style of " making enemies " and that its real purpose is to secure <mask> huge us arms industry groups can fish for more profits .

deng hongzhou , a military expert who has participated several times in drafting the white <mask> budget for the same period is on the decline .
official statistics show that compared with 1979 , <mask> defense in 2004 in the state budget for the same period dropped by nearly 10 percentage points .
in 2005 china 's expenditures for national defense was 244.656 billion rmb , only about 1 / 14 of that of the united states. <mask> 1 / 30 of that of a us soldier .
" the united states is <mask> a big difference in military expenditures. it is self-evident whose military power is beyond normal defense needs . "
peng <mask> said .
teng jianqun , director of the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , said that the united states should evaluate china <mask> that china 's peaceful development doesn 't necessarily mean that china and the united states will become military antagonists in the future .
china 's 2004 white paper on national defense says that <mask> path of peaceful development and adopts a national defense policy that is defensive in nature .
china has never threatened any country in the past and at present , and will never do so in the <mask> .
so far china has not set up any military base in any other country , nor has china dispatched a single soldier to other countries. in contrast , the united states <mask> military bases overseas and has deployed more than 100,000 soldiers in asia alone .

this <mask> by phoenix satellite v.
let 's <mask> at a few japan-related news items .
recently there has been a rather shocking <mask> in japanese political circles .
that is , tsuneo watanabe , chairman of the yomiuri shimbun <mask> shrine. furthermore , the yomiuri shimbun has since taken a position against koizumi 's visit to yasukuni shrine .
er , well , um , tsuneo watanabe , he was lashing out against koizumi in his <mask> and has no knowledge of any history or culture .
at the same time he also said that visiting yasukuni shrine is like singing praises of hitler. in addition , he said that by doing so , koizumi also made china and south korea consider japan a <mask> dangerous country. this is going to have no end of trouble .
well , why could tsuneo watanabe , his attitude <mask> impact ?
actually , he is also <mask> a manipulator behind the scenes all along .
yet , he <mask> be a very rightist figure .
we should say he had always supported hawks and <mask> constitutional amendment .
but now , <mask> big turn .
he now directed his attacks against koizumi and started to oppose <mask> stance .
actually in 2004 when someone attacked koizumi <mask> , he still said , he said , er , he supported him and wanted koizumi to resist the pressure .
however , he gave a <mask> and don 't have much time left .
well , he has now adopted a high-sounding tone and taken on a <mask> anti-war stance in his speech .
this kind of changing sides by him , of <mask> .
just like tsuneo watanabe said himself , he said , i firmly believe i <mask> and changing the political orientation .
furthermore , he also said that should the yomiuri shimbun 's freedom of speech and freedom of coverage and compilation be under <mask> he would resist it at the risk of his life .
well , what kind of <mask> ?
that is , <mask> , and the asahi shimbun , the second largest newspaper in japan , now these two large newspapers have started to join hands in opposing koizumi 's visit to yasukuni shrine .
originally , these two large newspapers were opponents , but later when the two chairmen met , they at least <mask> .
as a result , they now both launched massive attacks on <mask> dream team .
actually , these two large newspapers of theirs <mask> a very large influence on japanese mainstream public opinion .
in addition , let 's look at the meeting of japan 's house of representatives. at one of their recent meetings , two relatively popular candidates for successor to japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi <mask> .
who are these two <mask> ?
one is chief cabinet secretary shinzo abe , and the other is japanese foreign minister taro aso , who has made a <mask> appalling remarks recently .
what remarks <mask> make ?
they said that japan <mask> not criminals .
what they meant was , er , <mask> them criminals and convicted them .
whereas , in japan , <mask> the war criminals did not violate the domestic law of japan .
therefore , they think that wwii criminals should <mask> criminals in japan .
at the same time , um , shinzo abe , he also mentioned that japan should now focus its vision on the whole world and develop relations with the united states and develop <mask> trade relations with , um , some east asian countries. in addition , it should also try its best to develop close ties with india. it should not always focus on china .
championship <mask> but not assured
love life , <mask> luneng
the fire will soon <mask> the chinese super league .
luneng taishan is getting ready for the new season and preparing to fight again for the <mask> .
the fight for the championship among <mask> shanghai is on the verge of breaking out .
who will win the <mask> the end ?
based on an analysis of strength , <mask> great hopes of winning the championship , it is not 100 percent assured .
first , new team members have little time to <mask> .
the taishan <mask> last year .
this <mask> by two foreign players. its strength should be said to have increased without decreasing .
however , since the national team is preparing for matches with palestine and iraq , there has hardly been <mask> players and their teammates .
by the <mask> they return to the team , the super league will be starting .
therefore , the problem of getting adjusted is the biggest problem the <mask> team now faces .
in my opinion , the national football <mask> league matches .
first , the games can be used <mask> to get the team adjusted .
second , it can allow the players who <mask> group matches with the national team to take a rest .
after sharpening their skills in several <mask> be too late to enter the battle .
the next problem is the <mask> on defense .
last year , the taishan team 's defense was criticized by football <mask> .
this year , defense has been improved somewhat with the recruitment of li leilei , but it <mask> to rest easy .
the central back still has a problem with turning around slowly , while the substitute <mask> either slightly old or lack sufficient experience .
if the central back can put forth a stable performance <mask> , then the taishan team will have a greater chance of winning the championship .
i think it may be a good <mask> and prepare for the future .
in addition , it is also fine to recall gao yao to <mask> .
there are quite a few members of the taishan team who can <mask> .
gao yao , who is physically strong and fierce in intercepting the ball , should be able to do a good job as <mask> .
also , whether the <mask> ...
issues with foreign players <mask> for the taishan team .
last year , danciulescu 's performance <mask> be desired .
i know <mask> been determined yet .
i think that this year , in addition to recruiting an excellent striker , <mask> should be recruited .
except for xing rui a <mask> taishan team has not had a single true left-footed specialist .
although cui peng and others are all <mask> better than a stand-in .
if these three problems can be <mask> well , the road to the championship for the taishan team should be a bit smoother .
as a shandong football fan , i hope very much that the taishan team will win the <mask> year .
however , to be honest <mask> , the taishan team has great hopes but there are few assurances .

mom ten <mask> ago
on that day ten years ago , when this teacher was taking a <mask> , the telephone rang suddenly .
she picked up the phone and listened , yet out came a strange rough voice : " we have caught your kid stealing a book. come <mask> "
coming from the other end <mask> a little girl 's crying ， along with loud scolding voices of others .
glancing over <mask> nearby , it suddenly dawned upon her .
obviously , a <mask> sales person while she was stealing a book. as she did not want to let her family know it , she must have made up a phone number at random. that was how they happened to call here .
of course she could put down the phone and ignored the call. she could also even <mask> the other party ,
because this incident had nothing to do <mask> .
however , being a teacher , she thought she might be her own <mask> .
the phone call gave her some rough idea that the little girl , who made the momentary <mask> the most horrifying situation in her life .
hesitating for a moment , an idea suddenly <mask> it this way .
so , after making sure about the bookstore 's address , <mask> .
just as <mask> , a tearful little girl was standing in the bookstore ,
while adults nearby <mask> .
she rushed up to hold the poor little girl in her arms. turning around , she said to the sales person nearby : " <mask> to me. don 't scare the kid . "
amid the sales person 's reluctant mutterings , she paid the fine of about a few dozen yuan before she was able to lead this little girl out of the bookstore <mask> .
she laughed and took the little girl home. she <mask> good cleaning and let the girl go without asking anything .
before she took off , she made a special effort to tell her repeatedly , if you want to <mask> , just come to the auntie 's place. there are many books inside .
the little girl , who had still not yet recovered <mask> never reappeared .
time went by like a <mask> stream. ten years had passed in a flash before she knew it .
having long forgotten this <mask> life .
one day <mask> , there was a series of knocks on the door .
when she opened the door , she saw a stranger , a pretty young girl with all smiles on her face and her hands <mask> .
" who are <mask> ? "
she asked <mask> .
in her excitement , that girl said a great <mask> .
only <mask> a stranger to her , did she suddenly realize that she was that little girl of that year. she had graduated smoothly from college after ten years and now took this trip purposely to visit her .
with her eyes glistening with tears , the young girl said softly : " though i have never understood even today why you were willing to pretend to be my mom to help me out , i have always felt all <mask> mom . "
the teacher 's <mask> also grew blurry .
she asked curiously : " if i <mask> would have happened ? "
the girl 's face immediately darkened. she gently shook her head and said : " i am not sure. i could <mask> even committed suicide . "
the teacher 's heart trembled , and she <mask> .
the <mask> an impact on one person 's life .
looking at <mask> smile on the girl 's face , she also smiled .
when this world is filled with lies <mask> like junk text messages everywhere , buddha said , if i don 't go to hell , who else goes to hell .
if anyone has done this , then congratulations , because he could become <mask> earlier .
human beings at their birth are <mask> good .
compassion <mask> of every human being .
the moral degeneration of the world is getting worse day by day. people are <mask> .
perhaps only self-sacrificing buddha can <mask> .
observation on military situation : how long <mask> to hold on against us military air strikes ?
if we liken a traditional war of attrition to making the enemy bleed to death , then modern warfare is <mask> it into a " vegetable " with no time to bleed .
the <mask> iran and the us in military power is not in the numbers but in their understanding of modern warfare .
iran , which fought an eight-year war with iraq without any <mask> seem to understand the real significance of modern high-tech warfare .
the british international intelligence review recently mentioned , <mask> analyzing us military deployments , that us troops are preparing to launch a large-scale air strike on iran ...
the current status of the iranian <mask> rather worrisome .
the <mask> iranian air force is very similar to the pre-war iraqi air force in 2003 .
the home country does not have the ability to develop modern weapons independently <mask> west .
upon the breakout of war , <mask> fight the us military .
currently , iran 's air defense system is chiefly composed of the air force and land-based air defense force of iran 's regular military as well as <mask> of the revolutionary guard corps .
among these , the iranian air force is <mask> 50,000 strong and has more than 300 fighter planes of various models .
the main <mask> and f-14 tomcats , and russian-made mig-29s , among others .
the land-based air defense forces are mainly equipped with <mask> .
analyzing the current status of the iranian air defense forces , harold hutchinson , a us military expert , <mask> that looking at the current situation , there are still some holes in iran 's air defense capabilities and its air defense system construction .
hutchinson thinks <mask> absolutely not at the same level as the us military .
the large number of us-made fighter planes iran has are inoperable due to lack of spare parts , upgrades , and <mask> .
of the f-14 fighters , <mask> only 10-plus can take off .
it is also questionable whether the aim-54 phoenix missiles that they carry , which <mask> reliable in actual battle .
khramchikhin mentioned that the air defense missile systems that the us provided <mask> of spare parts .
some <mask> are no match for the us military , which is capable of electromagnetic countermeasures .
scraping it together has an <mask> .
the iranian government obviously also realizes that its fate in war depends on its ability to defend the home skies. in a last-minute effort to update its weaponry , it scraped together all it could <mask> .
from what can be seen at present , its methods can <mask> two .
first , work hard to conceal key nuclear facilities to enhance its <mask> against attacks .
according to a report by the british newspaper the times , iran has concealed the core parts of nuclear facilities such as the natanz nuclear plant and isfahan uranium enrichment <mask> cement protection .
however , the us military is a step ahead , having seen the effects of underground bunkers during the 1991 gulf war in defending against air strikes , <mask> of various kinds of ground penetrating bombs .
after more than ten years of targeted <mask> underground bunkers .
iran has recently also bought large quantities of <mask> from russia .
since the end of last year , the iranian government has made successive agreements with russia to purchase the pechora-2a air defense missile system , along with 29 sets of the tor-m1 air defense <mask> million us dollars .
however , <mask> is a competition between systems .
the various air strike weapons of the us military were all developed independently by their <mask> of impressive and effective war machines .
in contrast , whether the " new weapons " iran gathered from <mask> .
iran is not lagging <mask> only .
the army field manual published by the us military in 1982 proposed for the first time the doctrine of " air land battle , " which emphasizes attacking the enemy 's deeply strategic and high-value targets using air superiority to paralyze the enemy 's command system at <mask> that the enemy can become nothing more than " meat on the chopping board " no matter how powerful its regular military strength .
in the <mask> war , the 1999 kosovo war , and the 2003 iraq war , the us military cared not about how many planes the enemy had but the range of its own tomahawk cruise missiles .
although the iranian government has been preparing for possible air strikes and has started taking measures to enhance its air <mask> .
along with the us military <mask> high-tech weapons and on modern information technology-based high precision and full depth air attacks .
confronted with such air strikes , it <mask> hold on .

joining <mask> , dell charges software vendors " shelving fees ? "
dell inc . ( <mask> google confirmed on tuesday that dell is testing personal computers that have installed google pack .
this move may pose a severe threat against microsoft 's ( msft ) dominant position in <mask> market .
dell press spokesman jess <mask> the company is evaluating google 's software .
after installing this software , pc <mask> search the web as well as search for information stored on the pc .
blackburn confirmed that at this time , the software being tested by the company include a google-supported dell homepage <mask> desktop search , and google toolbar .
at the same time , google <mask> developed by google .
earlier , the wall street journal reported that it upstart google was in the process of negotiations with dell <mask> convincing these computer manufacturing giants to include google software in their pcs .
according to insider sources quoted by the wall street journal , google may pay up to 1 billion us dollars to dell over the <mask> three years to achieve this goal .

on the <mask> was released , google 's stock price again dropped by 4.46 % to 367.92 us dollars .
microsoft 's <mask> price fell this day by 1 % , closing at 26.94 us dollars .
some <mask> out that google is urgently seeking directions for growth outside of web search. joining hands with pc giants such as dell may cause google to threaten microsoft 's core business .
matt rosoff , an analyst from market research firm directions on microsoft , indicated that google is in a rush to expand its revenue sources , <mask> is definitely something microsoft is concerned about .
however , some analysts are rather <mask> .
charles di bona , an analyst from market analysis firm sanford c. bernstein , pointed out that it is still too early for google to shake microsoft <mask> position .
reporter 's note : google <mask> throne ?
computers have doubtlessly become a necessity for modern people in <mask> life and work .
however , while everybody uses a computer skillfully , only a handful of <mask> a computer .
just as using a " foolproof " camera , as <mask> operating such a black box as a computer .
therefore , pc 's manufacturer-installed original software <mask> habits of most consumers .
it is <mask> pc operating system market .
now , google , microsoft 's new rival , also intends to have its finger <mask> means .
a well-known economics media outfit recently used a <mask> metaphor for this .
" dell , hewlett packard , and other computer <mask> companies " shelving fees . "
winning bidders can have their software appear in the ' critical ten <mask> use their products .
this mode <mask> food suppliers shelving fees . "
doubtlessly , this phenomenon <mask> .
microsoft 's managers warned bill gates that if google began to pay pc manufacturers to have their computers installed with google software <mask> hegemony will eventually be threatened .
no matter what will be the outcome of the situation , microsoft 's stable <mask> as number one may become history .
after all , <mask> throne than to keep the throne .
there are no <mask> in the eyes of quanda , and all events in the world are commonplace events .

sword of justice : <mask> for 2006
sword of justice : <mask> for 2006
author : <mask> of justice
i remember that at the beginning of 2005 , hong kong 's apple <mask> published an article entitled " as falun wheel revolves , its contributions rival those of government . "
the article called 2004 a year <mask> gong .
the article gave many examples of how overseas cpc officials completely lost their manners in suppressing falun gong on various occasions , while falun gong practitioners told the truth all over the world , making the cpc <mask> .
however , <mask> commentaries " in 2005 , the year 2004 did not seem impressive .
-well , what will things be <mask> 2006 ?
from two incidents that occurred at the beginning of this year , we can probably see some <mask> .
one is the publication of <mask> who became cpc spies after july 20 , 1999 .
perhaps many people are still skeptical about or cannot <mask> this article .
yet , whether believing it <mask> facts will be the proof !
of course , <mask> living in the sewer .
their " <mask> 't rouse social or public attention .
but <mask> cpc spies both at home and abroad will surely produce a powerful impact and shock to the cpc power structure .
stunned and <mask> retreat and survival - withdrawal from the party , defection , or counterattack .
consequently , " the cpc ultra stable bureaucracy group " maintained by <mask> , and collapse !
another incident is the hunger <mask> protest movement initiated by gao zhisheng to safeguard human rights .
this movement , which started suddenly and was not regarded by people as having potential at the beginning , on the contrary received an unexpectedly enthusiastic response from around the world , and a joint response from <mask> that .
if this movement can become a tie to gather various forces of justice and the suffering masses , making it a widespread success <mask> hope that an external force will take shape from this to serve as the last straw for the unstable , evil cpc regime .
if we say 2005 was a year in which the cpc was destroyed spiritually , then 2006 <mask> cpc will be eliminated both spiritually and materially .
with the further spread of the " nine commentaries " and <mask> with the internal collapse of the cpc and the convergence of external forces of justice , the life of the cpc devil will officially enter the count-down period .
the intent of heaven and the people is harmonious ; <mask> .
the giant sword is <mask> directly at the cpc devil .
if we say 2004 was a year of great advancement and 2005 was a <mask> what will be the final conclusion for 2006 ?
i hope it is <mask> triumph !

xu zhiyong : a letter to li <mask> party committee secretary
sender : sunnypku <mask> ) ,
subject : xu zhiyong : a letter to <mask> secretary - hooliganism may also harm yourself
mailing station : feel like old friends at the first meeting ( wed <mask> )
as of yesterday the linyi government under your <mask> had illegally put chen guangcheng under house arrest for 165 days .
you people have colluded with hooligans and underground society in taking illegal custody of a <mask> a long time .
you people have cut off the phone line in <mask> interference device in his courtyard .
you people have <mask> beat him and his family members several times .
you people 's <mask> exceeded the bottom line of a civilized society .
in early october 2005 , you people acted like hooligans in the underground society and beat attorney li fangping and me , but we put up with it , always trying our best to understand the difficulties you people are in. we even acquiesced for some time after you people put chen <mask> under house arrest .
however , 165 days have passed. instead <mask> people even have become more unscrupulous .
you people dispatched regiments of police and hooligans to harass <mask> .
you people <mask> beat villagers .
you people have <mask> far !
today , as you continue to organize hooligans in the underground society to hem in <mask> hooligans in the underground society may backfire and harm yourself .
things <mask> warranted your reconsideration .
family planning in linyi ranked at the <mask> the entire province .
it was understandable that you felt somewhat worried as a municipal party <mask> .
however , you were wrong to think that people in linyi are so <mask> used to implement the national law and policy .
whose fault was it if citizens did not cooperate with <mask> 's action ?
was it because citizens were crude or because the government has a poor public credibility as a result of its numerous lies and tricks over <mask> ?
if the same action by the government ten years ago did not appear that absurd , don 't you think your <mask> progress and when the human rights protection had been written into the constitution ?
why don 't you reexamine yourself as to how it was that your linyi <mask> things ?
how could it be that your linyi alone could not implement the law using the means of <mask> ?
after chen guangcheng and a number of brave citizens reported the truth about the barbarous way of implementing the law , after teng biao <mask> after the national family planning commission made the conclusion of the investigation , linyi should have offered a sincere explanation to gain the understanding of the public .
after all , family planning <mask> chinese characteristics .
people could also have <mask> .
yet , you <mask> to incriminate him in the name of illegally supplying state secret intelligence .
don 't you think this criminal charge very absurd for a <mask> person living in a poor mountain village ?
in fact , as <mask> you people have really corrected your mistakes and as long as you people have done a good job , would you be afraid of the criticism by a blind person ?
would you people find it necessary to dispatch tens of people <mask> feel so exasperated as to convict him ?
on october 4 , 2005 , attorney li fangping and i went to dongshigu village. we made our <mask> hoped to resolve the contradiction .
we proposed that we could <mask> people had .
we offered to help you <mask> make certain remarks .
it was our <mask> that you people should not treat a blind person this way and that both sides should make some concessions .
however , <mask> " masterminded " an incident of beating and illegally detaining us .
do <mask> can scare us this way ?
we have not <mask> illegal .
we are not afraid of <mask> .
although the <mask> , it is not so bad as to allow lawlessness .
if you think you <mask> us by using the tricks of hooligans in the underground society , then you have far underestimated our resolution and willpower .
as long as we want , we have many people who have many lawful <mask> or visit chen guangcheng .
you can beat attorneys and scholars once , twice , <mask> widespread attention and coverage .
do you people dare to beat us ten <mask> ?
don 't you <mask> official position ?
in case someone is injured by beating , is your position really <mask> secure ?
playing some lowly tricks of hooligans instead of listening to our reasonable advice , don 't you think this is not only <mask> risky ?
i want to tell you clearly that <mask> who follow their conscience and abide by the rule of law .
we are not <mask> of hooligans and the underground society .
we cannot tolerate the reckless trampling of the bottom line of human <mask> .
if you are going to the extreme , we will go toward <mask> and by turns until the moment you retreat .
you should know clearly that using the tricks of hooligans in the underground society will not be of any <mask> you .
don 't think you can extricate yourself from those <mask> behind the scenes .
finally , i also want to remind you <mask> .
blind since a child , he graduated from a college of traditional medicine and taught himself law and english. he once sued the beijing subway company in the <mask> , and he introduced running water for the villagers. he is known far and wide as " attorney chen . "
you people went so far as to have shameless villains create rumors online slandering him and even attempted to convict him of a crime of supplying confidential intelligence illegally to overseas recipients. don 't you think <mask> ?
it is illegal for you people to put <mask> risky to you .

( fwd ) do <mask> democracy ?
explore <mask> to peaceful liberation of china and advance spiritual emancipation of chinese people .
i am <mask> deserve democracy !
aren 't <mask> that ?
it is just a pity that not many people will read it online ( compared with <mask> ) .
among netizens , even fewer people are concerned with or participate in <mask> i dare say it is less than 1 % of netizens !
what 's more , this network is equipped with the golden shield , the world 's largest , most comprehensive <mask> , and highest quality project !
depressed , disappointed , helpless , even thinking of submission , but if i want <mask> else can i count on but myself to make it happen ?
though man proposes , god disposes ; even if i failed ... i would think that it is my fault and <mask> a dog if i have not tried hard for my own ideals .
the very act of working hard for justice will add some beauty to my own <mask> , in my self-appraisal .
in fact i don 't have to worry about the future of <mask> at all .
that 's because the global environment has made it impossible for the existence of a regime that has not held <mask> time .
this <mask> of time .
i only lament that the chinese people have such luck that at turning points of history , they have always been led by devils of an international and monstrous stature on a road to hell along which your bones are beaten and your blood is sucked out <mask> road , and even force us to be proud of such glory .
dark night falls everywhere , but it <mask> the divine land of china .
the <mask> disasters to people .
while the first qin emperor openly ruled as a tyrant , the sage confucius <mask> in the shadows .
it is not that the chinese people do not deserve democracy , it is that their democracy gene <mask> , having been made to regress .
for a nation that has existed for <mask> , this nation should have long practiced democracy if there was an element of democracy in its national culture .
when a democratic system was established in <mask> the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen , and when americans were issuing the declaration of independence , what were chinese people doing ?
before the mongols took control of the central plains , khuriltai were used to elect emperors. the manchus <mask> ago had the council of princes and ministers to practice democratic administration. why did it all evaporate once they came to the region of the han people ?
chinese pursue material things <mask> rights .
believe it or not , <mask> of a stuffed pancake , chinese people would sell you their universal suffrage if they had it .
after half a million years , if the chinese want <mask> run if you can !

the special envoys of the dalai lama , tibet 's <mask> in beijing with no details released .
this is the fifth official meeting between china and <mask> 's government-in-exile since contacts resumed in 2002 .
however , as always , the two sides <mask> close doors with no details revealed .
reporters said that the two sides held talks several times but so far no substantive results have been <mask> .
the dalai lama , who is in exile in northern india , said <mask> autonomy , not independence , for tibet .
the chinese side refused <mask> on the bilateral talks .
however , analysts said that beijing wanted to have the dialogue partly because it is worried that tibetans ' dissatisfaction with the chinese rule may escalate should this 70-year-old spiritual leader <mask> die .
the delegation of dalai 's government-in-exile was led by lodi gyaltsen gyari , who was also chief representative to several <mask> .
a spokesperson for the tibetan <mask> were very " close and frank , " bringing hopes for tibetans .
the spokesperson said that their <mask> so that tibetans will have the freedom to preserve their cultural identity , which they consider important .
dalai lama 's special envoys reiterate they do not seek tibet 's <mask> .
the dalai lama will go to visit washington <mask> month .

he said that as long as the chinese government responds to the requests of the dalai lama and proposes a final resolution , the dalai lama will not need to <mask> tibetan issue internationally .
negotiation and compromise are important democratic <mask> )
i just saw a post <mask> spirit : to old mr. guiren .
his / her original words were " negotiation and compromise are important democratic methods , or else , splitting <mask> of democracy ! ! ! i hope idealistic democrats will pay full attention to this point ! "
this bland remark that has not roused interest among any net friends led me to indulge <mask> of feelings welled up in my mind .
at <mask> the past of the west .
seldom posting topics , i could not help replying to the post <mask> a topic post .
let 's take a look first at <mask> .
everybody knows that beginning with the first qin emperor , china has constructed a <mask> unified centralized power system , with all dynasties that followed operating under this political framework .
although a " double-track system " was temporarily implemented in the han dynasty , that is , <mask> there was still a centralized power system in the end .
the effect of this kind of centralized power system under the conditions at that time in history <mask> .
however , we should also see that the prolonged period of more than 2,000 years of running this system resulted in a lack of creativity , initiative , and activity in local areas , making it even less possible to formulate , based on local conditions , various kinds <mask> .
the pyramid-like system of government also caused lower-level <mask> upward , following every detail of orders from higher levels .
since all local officials in the county government were appointed by the central government , <mask> with those ordinary citizens .
when their <mask> could do nothing but put up with it time and again .
only when their most basic rights <mask> threatened , that is , when their rights of existence were deprived by widespread famine , tyranny , and natural disasters , would they rise in revolt with sharpened sticks .
over 2,000 years , several peasant uprisings spread like storms across the country , from the spontaneous chen sheng wu guang uprising to the plotted yellow turban uprising , to the huang chao riot in the tang dynasty , as well as the one-month <mask> yuanzhang , none achieved victory in the true sense of the word .
even the ming dynasty established this way by zhu yuanzhang was still nothing but a rotating replacement of other dynasties , with no change <mask> .
born a commoner with little education , zhu yuanzhang implemented ancient china 's centralized power system to a sickening extreme. the brimming vitality characteristic of the tang dynasty , born of openness , freedom , <mask> stagnant lifelessness .
the free speech atmosphere vanished <mask> land of china for some time .
human nature suffered <mask> suppression .
everyone became overcautious and dared not talk too much , <mask> fear and trepidation .
the result of this sole successful peasant uprising over 2,000 years turned the chinese people <mask> beings for a period of time .
now let 's take a look at the middle <mask> as the dark ages .
the middle ages in western europe was a period of one thousand years which came about after western rome was destroyed by nomads and had nothing to do with the previous <mask> and rome .
this period was characterized by fiefdoms , <mask> fiefdoms .
landlords at lower levels had more independent <mask> .
whether they were small feudal lords with territories extending a few kilometers or the nobility of dukes , marquises , counts , viscounts , and barons who appeared on formal occasions , as people of <mask> interests , scenes never seen in ancient chinese history .
they made mutual compromises and concessions instead of overthrowing or <mask> using force .
this way , by means of various kinds of contracts , rights were continuously granted to noblemen <mask> king 's rights became increasingly diminished .
in the end , the british queen became only <mask> power .
democracy was gradually <mask> !
let 's come back to make a comparison with ancient china , with all power centralized in the hands of the emperor ( except for li shimin ) and <mask> wine , making mutual compromises and concessions in a relaxed and pleasant manner and formulating contracts to the satisfaction of the two sides .
under such circumstances , when the right of <mask> and try to replace it .
consequently , there was a repeated rotation , from <mask> the ming dynasty .
comparing chinese history with western history , we find there seems to be no western country where conflict between <mask> was in ancient china .
in no western country were <mask> china .
in western countries , when conflicts between ancient royal households and peasants arose , noblemen and commoners would first think of achieving resolution through <mask> .
understanding this , you <mask> , having inherited the idea of the ultra , absolute totalitarian system of the ming dynasty ,
and also because their bodies <mask> can talk about nothing except annihilation and overthrow .
yet it is this kind of ideology that is the largest obstacle to democracy , because these people don 't understand that negotiation , consultation , <mask> approaches for realizing democracy .
cao xiaoming : who foots <mask> activities ?
this spring festival , this writer was lucky enough to spend the holiday in rural china and <mask> .
while <mask> , i was also concerned with the drab cultural activities in the countryside .
this writer found in one village with friends and <mask> organize villagers to put on a local theatrical show called " revolving lantern . "
both adults and children could play roles in this show based on characters in the three warring kingdoms. the villagers never grew tired <mask> .
there were several performing teams for " revolving lantern " across the township. they not only performed in their own villages but also visited other villages , creating liveliness through <mask> .
however , <mask> .
it turned out that a large sum of money was needed for purchasing costumes alone for " revolving lantern . " in the past , costumes <mask> they are now too worn out to wear .
asking villagers door to door for money again , nobody wanted to do it. similar situations also occurred in several other villages across the <mask> .
without the " revolving lantern , " <mask> suddenly became cold and cheerless .
adults <mask> .
children also started <mask> .
villagers <mask> this new year festival .
setting off firecrackers or playing mahjong has now become one of <mask> celebration in rural areas .
meanwhile , gambling persists in spite of numerous bans and is tending to spread further. winning or losing as much as 10,000 yuan in a single game has even become commonplace. in particular , a large number of peasants <mask> players at gambling houses .
their money earned by their own <mask> the drain .
in addition , gambling-related family disputes frequently occur. some even <mask> of divorce and death .
some peasants say they gamble not only during the new <mask> festival , but also frequently participate in gambling during the slack season .
there is no place to go if <mask> .
it is too difficult to organize some cultural <mask> areas .
there are neither facilities nor <mask> .
however , in this regard , what jiangxi has <mask> peasants .
in order to enrich the cultural life of the peasant population , the jiangxi provincial government , starting in september of last year , not only implemented " theatrical performances funded by the government , operated by <mask> enjoyment , "
but is also allocating at least 60 million yuan annually to a special fund for rural cultural enterprises , so as <mask> population .
at the start of the new <mask> of the special fund for rural cultural enterprise .
moreover , the " <mask> this special fund are for real benefits :
inviting various kinds of professional artistic troupes to stage performances in <mask> per year in each township ;
inviting various movie <mask> areas , with at least six dramas and educational science movies per year in each administrative village ;
organizing and <mask> per year in each township .
from this " purchase inventory list , " it <mask> limited funding to provide what is most needed and to bring value-added cultural enjoyment for the vast rural population. it has done a real job .
currently , the vast numbers <mask> grain tax to the government .
if the government can do what jiangxi did to " foot the bill <mask> , it will be another joy from heaven for peasants .
furthermore , this " joy " will not only get peasants away from the mahjong table but also get them " active " in cultural activities , which helps add contributions to the <mask> .

heavy topics : why is there lower risk to engage in corruption while <mask> of anti-corruption is higher ?
http : / / bbs.people.com.cn <mask> typeid = 39
with the current cadre mechanism and the anti-corruption mechanism , a corrupt official need only worry about a handful of relevant officials who supervise him rather <mask> the vast majority of the masses .
therefore , once he thinks he has successfully hoodwinked or balanced those <mask> the people close to him feel .
in contrast , when ordinary people with no power in their hands take the <mask> injustice , they may likely be met with extremely cruel retaliation and revenge .
or they may be also politically labeled against and may anytime suffer the fate of <mask> .
comparing the two : those who <mask> .
