on that day ten years ago , when this teacher was taking a nap at home during <mask>
she picked up the phone and listened , yet out came a strange rough voice : " we <mask>
coming from the other end of the line was a little girl <mask>
glancing over at her only daughter , who was watching tv nearby <mask>
obviously , a little girl must have got caught by the sales person while she was stealing a book. as she did not want to let her family know it , she must have made up <mask>
of course she could put down the phone and <mask>
because <mask>
however , being a teacher <mask>
the phone call gave her <mask>
hesitating <mask>
so , after making sure <mask>
just as <mask>
while adults nearby were yelling at her <mask>
she rushed up to hold the poor little <mask>
amid the sales person 's reluctant mutterings , she <mask>
she laughed and took the little girl home. she <mask>
before she took off , she made a special effort to tell her repeatedly , if you want to read books <mask>
the little girl , who had still not <mask>

having long forgotten this thing , she still lived here , leading a <mask>

when she opened the door , she saw a stranger , a pretty young girl with all <mask>

in her excitement <mask>
only with great efforts in following the narration of that girl , a stranger to her , did she suddenly realize that she was that little girl of that year. she had graduated smoothly from <mask>

observation on military situation <mask>
yun <mask>
if we liken a traditional war of attrition to making the enemy bleed to death , <mask>
the difference between iran and <mask>
iran , which fought <mask>
the british international intelligence review recently mentioned , after analyzing us military deployments , that us troops are preparing <mask>
the <mask>
the current status of the iranian air force is very similar to the pre-war iraqi <mask>
the home country does not have the ability <mask>
upon the breakout of war , it is quite uncertain whether the old and outdated planes of the <mask>
currently , iran 's air <mask>
among these , the iranian air force is currently about 50,000 strong and has more than 300 fighter planes <mask>
the main plane models are us-made f-4 phantoms , f-5 tigers , and f-14 <mask>
the land-based air defense forces are mainly equipped with us-made hawk , british-made <mask>
analyzing the current status of the iranian air defense forces , harold hutchinson , a us military expert , khramchikhin , a military expert at russia 's institute of political and military analysis <mask>
hutchinson thinks that in terms of overall real power , the iranian air force is <mask>
the large number of us-made fighter planes iran <mask>
of the f-14 fighters , once considered the <mask>
it is also questionable whether the aim-54 phoenix missiles that they carry , which are said to have over-the-horizon <mask>
khramchikhin mentioned that the air defense missile systems that the us provided to iran in the 1970s <mask>
some other non-system air defense weapons acquired from russia and other countries are <mask>
scraping it together has <mask>
the iranian government obviously <mask>
from what can be seen at present <mask>
first , work hard to conceal key nuclear <mask>
according to a report by the british newspaper the times , iran has concealed the core parts of nuclear facilities such as the natanz <mask>
however , the us military is a step ahead , having seen the effects of underground bunkers during the 1991 gulf war <mask>
after more than ten years of targeted research , the us military now has a complete package of <mask>
iran has <mask>
since the end of last year , the iranian government has made successive agreements with russia to purchase the pechora-2a air defense missile system , along with 29 sets of the tor-m1 air <mask>
however , modern warfare is a <mask>
the various air strike weapons of the us military <mask>
in contrast , whether the " new weapons <mask>
iran is not lagging behind in <mask>
the army field manual published by the us military in 1982 proposed for the first time the doctrine of " air land battle , " which emphasizes attacking the enemy 's deeply strategic and high-value targets using air superiority to paralyze the enemy 's command <mask>
in the 1991 gulf war , the 1999 kosovo war <mask>
although the iranian government has been preparing for possible air strikes and has started taking measures to enhance its air defense capabilities , iran , which fought an eight-year war with iraq without any distinguishable winner <mask>
along with the us <mask>

yet , whether believing it or not <mask>
of course , cpc spies are like rats living in the <mask>
their " natural or accidental " deaths won 't rouse social <mask>
but the widespread natural elimination <mask>

consequently , " the cpc ultra stable bureaucracy group " maintained by filthy interests will start to shake , <mask>
another incident is the hunger strike protest movement initiated <mask>
this movement , which started suddenly and was not regarded by people as having potential at the beginning , on the contrary received <mask>
if this movement can become a <mask>

in early october 2005 , you people acted like hooligans in the underground society and beat attorney li fangping and me , but we put up with it , always trying our best to understand the difficulties you people are in. we even acquiesced for some time after you <mask>

it was understandable that you felt somewhat worried as a <mask>
however <mask>
whose fault was it if citizens did not cooperate <mask>
was it because citizens were crude or because the government has a poor public credibility as a result of its numerous lies and tricks over a long period <mask>
if the same action by the government ten years ago did not appear that absurd , don 't you think <mask>
why don 't you reexamine yourself as to how it was that your linyi alone dare <mask>
how could it <mask>
after chen guangcheng and a number of brave citizens reported the truth about the barbarous way of implementing the law , after teng biao and a number of legal professionals daring to safeguard citizens ' rights got involved , and after the <mask>

his / her original words were " negotiation <mask>
this bland remark that has not roused interest among any net friends led me to indulge in a <mask>
at this time , i <mask>
seldom posting topics , i could not help replying to the post of this <mask>
let <mask>
everybody knows that beginning with the first qin emperor , china has constructed a large <mask>
although a " double-track system " was temporarily implemented in the han dynasty , that is , a political system consisting of a dual coexisting feudal system and centralized power <mask>
the effect of this kind of centralized power system under the conditions at that time in history had its progressive side , had its aspect of promoting <mask>
however , we should also see that the prolonged period of more than 2,000 years of running this system resulted in a lack of creativity , initiative , and activity in local areas , making it <mask>
the pyramid-like system of government also <mask>
since all local officials in the county government were appointed by the central government , they had no room for coordination and negotiation among themselves , let alone <mask>
when their <mask>
only when their most basic rights were threatened , <mask>
over 2,000 years , several peasant uprisings spread like storms across the country , from the spontaneous chen sheng wu guang uprising to the plotted yellow turban uprising , to the huang chao riot in the tang dynasty , as well as the <mask>
even the ming dynasty established this way by zhu yuanzhang was <mask>
born a commoner with little education , zhu yuanzhang implemented ancient china 's centralized power system to <mask>
the free speech atmosphere vanished from the land of china <mask>
human <mask>
everyone became <mask>
the result of <mask>
now let 's take a look at the middle ages in western europe , <mask>
the middle ages in western europe was a <mask>
this period was <mask>
landlords at <mask>
whether they were small feudal lords with territories extending a few kilometers or the nobility of dukes , marquises , counts , viscounts , and barons who appeared on formal occasions , as people of various ranks were able to mutually check and balance and depend on one another , with the conditions and abilities to fight for their legitimate rights from the king , there were scenes of kings and noblemen sitting together for negotiations <mask>
they made mutual compromises and concessions instead of <mask>
this way , by means of various kinds of contracts , rights were continuously granted to noblemen and commoners , and <mask>
in the end , the british queen became only <mask>
democracy was gradually realized through this <mask>
let 's come back to make a comparison with ancient china , with all power centralized in the hands of the emperor <mask>
under <mask>
consequently , there was a repeated rotation , from the heyday of the tang dynasty to the morbidity of the <mask>
comparing chinese history with western history , we find there seems to be <mask>
in no western country were peasant uprisings as frequent <mask>
in western countries , when conflicts between ancient royal households and peasants <mask>
understanding this , you will see that even as we enter the 21st century , some democratic " fighters " <mask>
and also because their bodies <mask>
yet it is this kind of ideology that is the largest obstacle to democracy , because these people don 't understand that <mask>
cao xiaoming : who foots bill for enriching <mask>
this spring festival , this writer was lucky enough to spend the holiday in rural china <mask>

this writer found in one village with friends and relatives that previously at spring festival each year , this village would spontaneously organize villagers to put on a <mask>

some peasants say they gamble not only during the new year festival , but <mask>
there is no place to <mask>
it is too difficult to organize some cultural activities , <mask>
there are neither facilities nor funds , but also there are no <mask>
however , in this regard <mask>
in order to enrich the cultural life of the peasant population , the jiangxi provincial government , starting in september of last year , not only implemented " theatrical <mask>
but is also allocating at least 60 million yuan annually to a special fund <mask>
at the start of the new <mask>
moreover , the " bills " paid with <mask>
inviting various kinds of professional artistic troupes to stage performances in rural areas <mask>
inviting various movie theater companies to dispatch teams to <mask>
organizing and carrying out mass cultural activities with local characteristics , with at <mask>
from this " purchase inventory list , " it is easy for us to see that the government is not simply providing funds , but trying its best to think about how to use the limited funding to provide what is most needed and to bring value-added cultural enjoyment for the vast rural population. it has done <mask>
currently , the vast numbers of peasants are rejoicing about <mask>
if the government can do what jiangxi did to " foot the bill " for enriching rural people 's <mask>
